1377,asian stocks sink euro near nine year ,"HONG KONG: Asian markets tumbled Tuesday following painful losses in New York and Europe while the euro sat near nine-year lows as political uncertainty in Greece fanned renewed fears it could leave the eurozone.Oil prices, which fell below the psychological $50 a barrel mark in US trade, edged up marginally but remained under pressure owing to a global supply glut, weak demand and a stronger dollar.Tokyo tumbled 2.50 percent, Hong Kong lost 0.89 percent, Sydney eased 1.67 percent, Seoul was 1.30 percent lower while Shanghai reversed earlier losses to gain 0.70 percent.The first full week of the new year got off to a traumatic start for dealers as they bet a January 25 general election in Greece will see a victory for the the left-wing Syriza party.Markets fear the party will roll back austerity measures required under the IMF-EU bailout of the country, which could in turn lead it to exit the eurozone.The year is ""barely three trading days old and already the two biggest themes that were predicted to affect the markets this year are making headlines: oversupply of commodities and the eurozone,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., wrote in an email to clients, according to Bloomberg News.At the weekend, Der Spiegel quoted German government sources as saying they consider Greece´s exit ""almost inevitable"" if Syriza wins the snap poll.Chancellor Angela Merkel and finance minister Wolfgang Schaeuble had come to consider Athens´ removal from the bloc would be ""manageable"", the magazine said.However, investors were spooked and on Monday Greek stocks sank more than 5 percent, while the Paris, Madrid and Milan exchanges fell more than 3 percent.- Oil below $50 a barrel -The Dow dived 1.86 percent, the S&P 500 fell 1.83 percent and the Nasdaq lost 1.57 percent.In currency trade the euro sank to $1.1864 Monday, its lowest level since March 2006. On Tuesday morning the single currency recovered slightly buying $1.1943.The euro was meanwhile at 142.58 yen against 142.74 yen in US trade and well down from the 144.58 yen Friday.Adding to downward pressure is increased speculation that the European Central Bank will buy eurozone government bonds to counter deflation risks.The dollar was at 119.40 yen early Tuesday, compared with 119.61 in New York Monday and also well down from 120.46 yen Friday.Oil prices were marginally up Tuesday after slipping below $50 for the first time in more than five years in New York.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery rose eight cents to $50.12 while Brent crude for February gained 14 cents to $53.25. WTI tapped $49.95 Monday.The cost of crude has plunged since June as supplies outstrip demand with key consumer China slowing down, the eurozone struggling and the dollar, in which it is priced, strengthening.A decision late last year by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to maintain output despite the glut has also cut into prices.""The fundamentals of oil are unlikely to change in the first half of this year, which will see oil bedding down into its bear market for months to come,"" IG´s Lucas said.Gold was at $1,203.59.40 an ounce, compared with $1,196.40 on Monday.

1378,us oil prices slip below 50 a barr,"NEW YORK: US oil prices Monday slipped below $50 a barrel for the first time in more than five years as the surging dollar and news of additional supplies extended a six-month rout.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for February delivery, in free fall since June, ended at $50.04 a barrel, down $2.65 or five percent. The contract got as low as $49.95 a barrel earlier in the session, its lowest level since May 1, 2009.European benchmark Brent oil for February delivery fell $3.31 to $53.11 a barrel in London.Monday´s slide in oil prices followed indications of rising output from key producers Russia and Iraq at a time when forecasters have trimmed their demand projections due to weak global economic growth.The breaching of the psychologically important $50 level also came on a turbulent day for global financial markets. US stocks fell nearly two percent, approaching the drops in European equity markets as the euro plunged to a nine-year low on revived eurozone worries.A long rally in the greenback, which gained 11 percent last year against a basket of major currencies, has weighed on the dollar-priced oil market by making crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies.Oil prices could fall further still, analysts say.""There´s serious concern the bottom´s not in yet,"" said Kyle Cooper, managing partner at IAF Advisors in Houston. ""Basically everyone who´s taken a stab at the bottom has been wrong.""""Oil prices attempted to stabilize during the last two weeks, but the fundamentals remain weak,"" said Gene McGillian, broker and analyst at Tradition Energy. ""The market is trying to come to a bottom. It could be anybody´s guess, but it appears we still have more to go.""Fawad Razaqzada, a technical analyst at Forex.com., said the drop below $50 a barrel could trigger more selling, paving the way for oil to fall as low as $45 or $40 a barrel in the coming weeks.-Weak fundamentals-The retreat in prices comes on the heels of a multi-year boom in US oil production that has shaken the global petroleum market and put the US in a league with oil giants Russia and Saudi Arabia.Other leading producers are also pumping aggressively. Iraq´s oil ministry last week released figures showing that December crude exports reached their highest since 1980.Meanwhile, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries has consistently ruled out action despite the months-long slide in prices.In November, the cartel met in Vienna and took no action, as key powerbrokers like Saudi Arabian oil minister Ali al-Naimi said he preferred for the market to balance itself. In December, Naimi told a Middle East publication the group would take the same hands-off approach even if oil fell to $20 a barrel.Meanwhile, economic growth remains uncertain in Europe and in many emerging economies, such as China and Brazil. The International Energy Agency in December projected global crude inventories could rise by nearly 300 million barrels in the first six months of 2015. The agency also cut its demand outlook by more than 200,000 barrels a day for 2015.Energy equities, by far the worst performing sector in the S&P 500 last year, suffered more pain Monday.

""This does not make for a rosy outlook for the world.""February Brent crude LCOc1 dropped 55 cents to $46.04 a barrel by 0927 GMT and West Texas Intermediate crude for February CLc1 was at $45.29, down 60 cents.""There's clearly a souring of sentiment towards industrial commodities and I think that's spilling over to oil today,"" said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney.""Potentially this selling is now being overdone, but today there's no sign of a turnaround,"" he said.Analysts said prices would stay under pressure as oversupply hurts both WTI and Brent, and a string of them have cut price forecasts for 2015 and 2016.Oil had tumbled nearly 5 percent on Tuesday before closing down 1.8 percent, with global benchmark Brent briefly trading at par to US prices for the first time in three months as some traders moved to take advantage of ample US storage space.US stocks are possibly approaching 80 percent of capacity by the upcoming spring season, according to US-based PIRA Energy Group.Commercial crude stockpiles in the US rose 3.9 million barrels last week, the industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) said. The Energy Information Administration's oil inventory report is due Wednesday at 1530 GMT.Outside the United States, some of the world's biggest oil traders have booked supertankers to store at least 25 million barrels at sea.""Once floating storage starts, there is very little support on the downside for Brent spreads,"" analysts Energy Aspects said.With oil producer club OPEC deciding late last year to maintain its output despite slowing Asian and European economic growth, a glut has also appeared outside the United States.""The closing gap looks to be solidifying Saudi Arabia's strategy to curb shale production and protect market share,"" ANZ bank said.

1383,new saudi king seen holding line on opec policy to keep oil output hig,"SINGAPORE: Saudi Arabia's new king is expected to continue a policy of keeping oil output steady to drive out rival producers, though the royal succession has focused market attention on the future of the kingdom's long-serving oil minister.King Abdullah died early on Friday and his brother Salman became king, the royal court in the world's top oil exporter said in a statement.Salman named his half-brother Muqrin as heir, rapidly moving to forestall any succession crisis at a moment when Saudi Arabia faces unprecedented turmoil on its borders.While the new king is not seen as likely to change Abdullah's policies of keeping output high to protect the OPEC cartel's market share, some analysts said the succession has focused attention on the future of the oil minister Ali Al-Naimi.""King Abdullah was the architect of the current strategy to keep production high and force out smaller players instead of cutting,"" said John Kilduff, partner, Again Capital LLC in New York, adding that he expected Salman to keep production high.FGE analyst Tushar Bansal said: ""By and large, as of now, no major change is expected in Saudi policies"" but he said the market would focus on whether the oil minister might step down.""Ali Al-Naimi has been the oil minister since 1995... It was reported that he expressed a desire to step down, but King Abdullah asked him to stay on for as long as he is around. So, the real question is, if there is a new oil minister soon, will it lead to a change in Saudi energy policy?""IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said speculation over the fate of the oil minister could add to market uncertainty though he did not expect a change of minister or in overall policy.""The decision on Saudi Arabia to keep pumping (oil) was made regardless of who the king may be,"" said Shum.Saudi leaders were also unlikely to want to repeat some previous policy misfires.In the 1980s, Saudi Arabia cut its own output to prop up prices in the face of falling demand and rising supplies from non-OPEC suppliers but was dealt a double blow from lower prices and reduced output.Saudi policymakers would be determined not to make the same mistake again, analysts said.Crude oil futures jumped on Friday after news of the Saudi king's death but later came off their highs and were still trading at levels more than 50 percent below their most recent peaks in June, 2014.

1384,euro maintains gains asia stocks adv,"Hong Kong: The euro extended its gains against the dollar Tuesday while Asian equities climbed on hopes Greece´s new government will be able to negotiate a bailout deal with the EU and IMF that will avoid it leaving the eurozone.Regional investors took their lead from advances in Europe and New York, where news of Sunday´s Greek election win for anti-austerity party Syriza had been largely factored in, analysts said.Tokyo jumped 1.44 percent by lunch, Sydney added 0.67 percent, Shanghai edged up 0.10 percent, Seoul rose 0.46 percent and Hong Kong was flat.Markets have been buoyed by rhetoric coming out of Athens and its creditors that raises hopes they two sides can reach an agreement over Greece´s repayment of its 240-billion-euro bailout.Syriza had campaigned on renegotiating terms of the lifeline -- which included swingeing spending cuts and painful tax hikes -- and there are concerns it will default on its repayments, leading to its possible exit from the eurozone.But International Monetary Fund head Christine Lagarde said she was prepared to continue its financial support to the country, while some European finance ministers suggested they were willing to talk, as long as Syriza did not demand its debt be wiped out.The messages coming out of Europe helped shares higher. In Europe, equities in London, Paris and Germany all closed with healthy gains, although Athens lost more than three percent.Dow edged 0.03 percent higher, the S&P 500 added 0.26 percent and the Nasdaq put on 0.29 percent.""The Greek elections had the potential to unnerve the market,"" Nader Naeimi, at AMP Capital Investors in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.""It´s quite encouraging that the new government and the EU are willing to negotiate.

Crude has shed nearly 60 percent of its value in an almost uninterrupted slide since June due to a supply glut, largely boosted by robust US shale-oil production and weaker global economic growth.The greenback has been strengthening for months, making dollar-priced oil relatively more expensive, adding to the pressure on the oil market.A slight easing in the dollar Tuesday against major rival currencies such as the euro, yen and pound underpinned the buying, Cooper said.""I didn´t see anything bullish today"" for WTI, he said. ""Equities are down, durable goods (are) not that good.""New orders for long-lasting US industrial goods unexpectedly fell in December, by a steep 3.4 percent, signaling some persistent weakness in the manufacturing sector.Saudi Aramco, the world´s largest oil company in terms of crude production and exports, acknowledged that prices have fallen too far but it was up to the market, not OPEC producers, to shore them up.""It´s too low for everybody,"" said Khalid al-Falih, the president of the state-owned energy giant, told a conference in Riyadh. ""I think even consumers start to suffer in the long term.""Falih also said US shale-oil production is important for the world´s long-term energy future and Saudi Aramco has earmarked an additional $7 billion for its own shale projects.The kingdom is the leading exporter and top producer in the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, which provides about a third of global oil supplies.In November, OPEC resisted calls to reduce output in the face of falling prices, keeping its output ceiling at 30 million barrels per day in a decision that exacerbated the global price slump.

It wasn't yet clear if the probe would result in a lawsuit.If the investigation is confirmed, Moody's would become the second major US credit-rating firm in the Justice Department's crosshairs, after a case against Standard & Poor's.S&P is expected to within days agree to pay $1.37 billion to settle lawsuits over its rosy grading of mortgage bonds in the financial crisis, sources told AFP.Neither Moody's nor the Justice Department were immediately reachable for comment Sunday.US authorities are probing whether the firm compromised its standards to score deals, the Journal reported, and the focus is on residential mortgage deals from about 2004 to 2007.Positive ratings on what turned out to be extremely risky mortgage deals, known as subprime loans, were a main cause of the 2008 financial collapse.Investors rely on rating firms' grades to assess risk.Numerous banks have already paid huge fines and settlements for their roles in packaging and selling the bonds as low-risk, solid investments.

The Guardian, along with other news outlets, cited documents obtained by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) via Le Monde.HSBC said that its Swiss arm had not been fully integrated into HSBC after its purchase in 1999, allowing ""significantly lower"" standards of compliance and due diligence to persist.The Guardian alleged in its report that the files showed HSBC's Swiss bank routinely allowed clients to withdraw bricks of cash, often in foreign currencies which were of little use in Switzerland, marketed schemes which were likely to enable wealthy clients to avoid European taxes and colluded with some to conceal undeclared accounts from domestic tax authorities.HSBC said the Swiss private banking industry, long known for its secrecy, operated differently in the past and this may have resulted in HSBC having had ""a number of clients that may not have been fully compliant with their applicable tax obligations.""Its private bank, especially its Swiss arm, had undergone ""a radical transformation"" in recent years, it said in a detailed four-page statement.HSBC's Swiss private bank was largely acquired as part of its purchase of Republic National Bank of New York and Safra Republic Holdings, a US private bank.HSBC said the number of accounts in its Swiss private bank had fallen from 30,412 in 2007 to 10,343 at the end of last year and it was cooperating with authorities investigating tax matters.The data was supplied by Herve Falciani, a former IT employee of HSBC's Swiss private bank. HSBC said Falciani downloaded details of accounts and clients at the end of 2006 and early 2007. French authorities have obtained data on thousands of the customers and shared them with tax authorities elsewhere, including Argentina.Switzerland has charged Falciani, who Reuters was unable to reach for comment, with industrial espionage and breaching the country's secrecy laws. Falciani has previously told Reuters he is a whistleblower trying to help governments track down citizens who used Swiss accounts to evade tax.Some of the details of the list have been released before. The names of 2,000 Greeks with HSBC accounts was made public in 2010 and dubbed the ""Lagarde List"" after former French finance minister Christine Lagarde. France passed the names to Greece to help it crack down on tax evasion.

WTI then continued to fall further in late trade, dropping below $50.In London, Brent crude for April delivery was flat at $60.22 a barrel, one cent higher from a day earlier.US and Canadian output continued to rise despite the weak market, adding to the gap between the two key benchmarks.""Still-rising US production and climbing inventories remain the more relevant fundamental story,"" said Timothy Evans of Citi Futures.Analysts at JPMorgan said reports of production and export drops in the Middle East and North Africa helped hold up London prices.""An additional support also comes from higher crude demand in Europe from strong refinery margins and US refinery maintenance allowing refiners elsewhere to fill the product supply gap,"" they said.""We continue to expect that crude markets will come under pressure in the short term, however, fundamentals point to stress on Brent-related crude outweighing that on WTI.""More broadly, they said they foresee overall demand will decline as refineries adjust to different conditions, further pressing downward on prices.""Assuming that Brent markets witness a reversal of the supply losses that have tightened them significantly in recent weeks, then we would expect weaker Brent cash differentials and structure to erode the support for Brent crude against other benchmarks, notably WTI.""

1399,fbr moves to widen tax net but big fish yet to be caug,"ISLAMABAD: The Federal Bureau of Revenue (FBR) has begun chasing wealthy tax-dodgers who enjoy lives of extravagance and luxury, but revenue officials face huge challenges in trying to force the very richest  and most influential  to pay up.Pakistan's tax-to-GDP ratio of 9.5 percent is among the lowest in the world and the government is under pressure from foreign donors and lenders, including the International Monetary Fund (IMF), to increase collection to boost the struggling economy.Revenue authorities say they have identified about a quarter of a million new taxpayers who they project will add around 14 billion rupees ($140 million) to government coffers.Broadening the tax base and improving the economy after years of drift and sluggish growth under the last government was a key pledge in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif´s 2013 election campaign, when he was swept to power for a third time.Currently less than one percent of Pakistanis pay income tax and the government collected just $8 billion in total income tax in the 2013-14 fiscal year  barely enough to cover just the country´s defence expenditure of $7 billion.The finance ministry is aiming to boost the tax-to-GDP ratio to 15 percent in the current fiscal year ending June 30.As part of those efforts, the FBR is compiling lifestyle and vehicle data to try to trace unregistered taxpayers, including wealthy landlords and businessmen zipping between their luxury homes in imported Mercedes.""We are collecting information from the vehicle registration authority, car manufacturers, utility companies, telecom companies and property registration offices and tracing people who are not paying any tax,"" FBR spokesman Shahid Hussain told AFP.Taxpayer profilesThe data is used to generate profiles of potential taxpayers, after which demands are issued for them to pay income tax.""FBR has already issued notices to 261,250 potential tax payers,"" Hussain told AFP, adding that that new taxpayers have paid 570 million rupees since the crackdown started.It is not just dodgy businessmen who have been caught  several lawmakers have been found paying either no tax or very little and not filing their mandatory annual tax statements.The FBR has taken punitive measures against some ""chronic defaulters"", freezing nearly 300 bank accounts, seizing more than 100 vehicles, putting 78 properties up for sale and issuing arrest warrants in 40 cases.""Employing information technology, the FBR is creating a central database which would contain information about all taxpayers and nobody will be left undetected,"" Hussain said.A new FBR department tasked with broadening the tax net started working in July 2013 and within one year it started showing results, he added.But Pakistan is a country where wealth and political influence go hand in hand. For generations, landowners and industrialists have given patronage to political parties and scant attention has been paid to their assets by the taxman.Changing this privileged arrangement is a tricky proposition.Umar Cheema, an investigative journalist for Pakistani daily The News who has done several major exposes on tax-dodgers, says the FBR´s commitment is encouraging, but he does not expect them to net any big fish.´War on tax cheats´""FBR is after those who can´t influence them,"" Cheema told AFP, citing several well-known tycoons considered among Pakistan´s richest whose names were missing from a list of the country´s top 100 taxpayers.""It can be done only by waging a war against tax cheaters without discrimination of good and bad cheaters,"" Cheema said.Pakistan´s central bank said in a recent report that tax revenue growth was not keeping up with budget targets.The tax take grew 11.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, against an annual target of 26.9 percent  but this was only half the growth of the same period during the previous fiscal year, according to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).The central bank has urged the government to simplify tax procedures and do more to increase the documentation of the economy.A vast amount of business in Pakistan is done off the books, making transactions hard to trace and levy dues on.""Although FBR has taken a number of measures to increase tax collection, these focused more on deductions at source, and/or increasing the tax rates,"" a recent SBP report said, warning such measures had enjoyed ""limited success"" in the past.The IMF, though, has said the government´s reform programme  tied to a $6.6 billion loan from the Washington-based lender  was on track, and expects growth to accelerate to 4.3 percent in the 2014-15 fiscal year from 4.1 percent previously.But even with growth quickening and officials insisting they are making inroads, challenges to the government´s efforts to gather taxes remain considerable.

European benchmark Brent North Sea crude for April fell 79 cents to $53.38 a barrel in midday London trade.Crude futures had plunged by more than two dollars on Friday after the International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of US crude reserves reaching storage capacity with little sign of a slowdown in output despite a global glut. ""Selling pressure was generated on Friday by the IEA, which warned that storage capacities could soon be exhausted in the United States,"" said Commerzbank analysts.""The reason cited by the IEA was the massive oversupply, which stems first and foremost from the still rising US oil production.""The US Department of Energy last week said stockpiles in the world´s top crude consumer climbed to a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week. ""This week could be even more bearish for oil as there has been no shift in supply,"" Michael McCarthy, chief market strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told AFP. Singapore-based Phillip Futures said ""with fundamentals remaining unchanged, we hardly find a reason for crude oil to break higher or even lower"". Crude prices lost some 60 percent of their value to decline to about $40 per barrel between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and the soaring dollar.Prices have since rebounded following a slowdown in US oil-drilling activities, but analysts say volatility is likely to continue for some time.""Behind the facade of stability, the rebalancing triggered by the price collapse has yet to run its course, and it might be overly optimistic to expect it to proceed smoothly,"" the Paris-based IEA, which advises energy consuming nations, said last week. McCarthy said oil prices are also under pressure owing to gains in the dollar against other major currencies ahead of a closely watched US Federal Reserve policy meeting on Wednesday. A stronger US dollar makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand. (AFP)

She noted consumer spending has slipped, inflation has declined, wages are flat, and the stronger dollar has hurt US exports.The policy committee lowered its rate outlook to 0.5-0.75 percent for the end of this year from 1.0 percent previously, while also reducing its 2016 forecast to 1.75-2.5 percent from 2.5 percent. ""Just because we removed the word patient from the statement doesn´t mean we´re going to be impatient,"" Yellen told reporters.Markets have been focusing on the Fed´s timing for a rate hike -- a plus for the dollar -- with Yellen´s comments giving much-needed relief for the euro, which has been hammered by the European Central Bank´s new stimulus programme.While some analysts pegged the dollar to fall further, loose monetary policy in major economies was likely to stem its losses, said Sebastien Galy, a senior currency strategist at Societe Generale.""The dollar will resume its uptrend vs G10 in the next few weeks driven by the pressure of negative interest rates elsewhere,"" he wrote in an e-mail, according to Bloomberg News.

1404,global oil prices fall as iran nuclear framework reached,"NEW YORK: Crude-oil prices fell Thursday after six world powers and Iran announced they had agreed on a framework to curb Irans nuclear drive.With the tentative deal, if confirmed, likely to allow Iran crude exports back on the markets, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in May, the global benchmark contract, slumped $2.15, settling at $54.95 a barrel in London trade.The US benchmark, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for May delivery, shed 95 cents to close at $49.14 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Traders have been following the marathon negotiations closely. Shortly before the New York market closed, the world powers and Iran said that Tehran has agreed to curtail its nuclear program in return for the lifting of US and European Union nuclear-related sanctions that have harmed its economy.Lifting sanctions could open up the flow of Iranian crude to an oversupplied global market. The glut has pushed crude prices more than 50 percent lower since last June.The outline of the deal marked a major breakthrough in a 12-year standoff between Iran and the West, which has long feared Tehran wants to build a nuclear bomb. Iran has insisted the nuclear program is for peaceful purposes.At the beginning of the press conference in Lausanne, Switzerland, the price of WTI, which had been trading lower since the market opened, fell to $48.11 a barrel before paring its losses.The countries announced the drafting of a full agreement would begin immediately, with a June 30 deadline for completion.The sanctions would be lifted after the UN atomic agency verifies Iran has fulfilled the terms of the deal.The so-called P5+1 group  the United States, Britain, China, France and Russia plus Germany  hope that the deal will make it virtually impossible for Iran to make nuclear weapons under the guise of its civilian program.Commerzbank analysts, citing shipping sources, said earlier this week that Iran has at least 30 million barrels of crude oil in storage onboard tankers that could quickly move onto the market if sanctions were lifted.Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves. The OPEC member´s crude exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million bpd because of the US-EU sanctions.Traders also kept an eye on the latest Baker Hughes count of US crude-oil drilling rigs, looking for clues that the strong US crude output could be easing. The count fell by 11 rigs from last week, and the number of operating rigs has fallen more than 50 percent since October.

1406,asia shares mostly up china data disappoi,"Hong Kong: Most Asia markets climbed Monday, with Hong Kong advancing for an eighth straight session and Shanghai rallying after another disappointing batch of Chinese data that will add to hopes for fresh easing measures.Wall Street provided another strong lead, boosted by a string of merger announcements last week and a huge asset sale by General Electric (GE).Hong Kong was up 0.41 percent -- adding to the more than 11 percent gain seen over the past seven days -- while Shanghai ticked 1.30 percent higher. Sydney added 0.20 percent and Seoul put on 0.12 percent, but Tokyo retreated 0.13 percent by lunch.In China the customs administration said imports and exports sank in March, the latest figures to show the world´s number two economy continues to struggle. However, they will also reinforce investors´ expectations that authorities will unveil a new round of growth-fuelling policies.Those expectations have powered a rally in Shanghai shares to seven-year highs over the past 12 months, and now mainlanders are jumping into Hong Kong´s market looking for what they consider cheap equities. Hong Kong´s Hang Seng Index has climbed more than 11 percent over the past seven sessions, and is on course for another rise Monday.Turnover hit two successive records last week as traders north of the border make the most of a link-up between the index and Shanghai´s exchange.While the stock connect programme was initially met with little interest, the decision by mainland authorities last month to expand the number of fund-management firms allowed to buy in Hong Kong has seen activity surge.Attention will now turn to the release Wednesday of Chinese economic growth figures for the first three months of the year.In New York the Dow got a bump from GE´s announcement that it will sell $26.5 billion in real estate assets as part of a plan to pare off most of its GE Capital unit over the next 24 months. That came at the end of a week that also saw major mergers including Royal Dutch Shell and FedEx.The Dow climbed 0.55 percent, the S&P 500 rose 0.52 percent and the Nasdaq gained 0.43 percent.On currency markets the dollar was at 120.31 yen, compared with 120.30 yen in New York.The euro bought $1.0590 and 127.41 yen against $1.0599 and 127.50 yen.Oil prices edged higher.

1407,oil climbs for 5th day as us output edges lower,"New York: US oil prices shot up to a 2015 peak Wednesday after a slight dip in US oil production sparked talk that the glutted petroleum market could be turning.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for May delivery jumped $3.10 to $56.39 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest closing price since December 23.European benchmark Brent oil for delivery in May rose $1.89 to $60.32 a barrel in London.The gains extended a market rally into a fifth straight day.Earlier in the day, the US Department of Energy reported US oil production fell by 20,000 barrels, or 0.2 percent, to 9.38 million barrels per day, in the week ending April 10.US crude inventories stand at the highest level for this time of year in at least the last 80 years, the DoE said, but the increase last week was smaller than expected.Analysts expressed caution at Wednesday´s price surge.""I think this rally will stall,"" said Matt Smith, an analyst at Schneider Electric. ""We got quite a bit ahead of ourselves here."" Smith said it is likely still too soon for the lower US rig count to meaningfully dent supply.""Yes, there are a couple of data points, but that doesn´t mean the US is not overflowing crude,"" he said.Meanwhile, the Paris-based International Energy Agency cut its supply forecast for non-OPEC countries, citing a lower outlook for US and Canadian production and the ""worsening conflict"" in Yemen.The agency also bumped up by 90,000 barrels per day its forecast for 2015 petroleum demand. The IEA now expects 2015 consumption of 93.6 million barrels per day, up 1.1 million barrels per day for the year. (AFP)

The single currency bought $1.0733 and 128.20 yen against $1.0741 and 128.05 yen on Wall Street.Hong Kong and Shanghai resumed their upward trend after sharp losses Monday that came after China´s stock market regulator tightened rules on trading with borrowed money and increase the supply of shares for short-selling.Confidence was buoyed by Sunday´s cut by the People´s Bank of China in the amount of cash lenders must hold in reserve, the move aimed at helping kick-start the economy, which grew in January-March at its slowest quarterly pace in six years. The next indicator on the state of China´s economy comes with HSBC´s preliminary index of manufacturing activity on Thursday.US traders welcomed that move.

The move took effect Monday.""While additional RRR cuts were expected throughout 2015, the size and timing of this cut indicates leaders are more deeply concerned about the state of the economy than official comments previously indicated,"" said Brian Jackson, China economist at IHS Global Insight.Jackson noted it was the largest RRR reduction since November 2008 amid the global financial crisis.Lifted in early trade by the Chinese action, prices retraced some gains after Saudi Arabia´s oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, pointed to strong crude production, only for prices to rise again on a bullish forecast for US inventories.""It´s been choppy,"" said John Kilduff of Again Capital.Investors, he said, are ""trying to determine when the production tide is going to turn"" in the United States, which has been pumping out historic amounts of crude despite a global supply glut.Kilduff said a report by energy information company Genscape, showing that crude reserves at the key storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, had fallen by 900,000 barrels, had boosted trader sentiment.Dealers are also reading a drop in US oil rig activity as a sign of a production slowdown that could alleviate the global oversupply and push up prices that have halved since mid-2014.""There may be scope for oil prices to be lifted further in the near term both by falling US oil output and crude stock data, and by better news on the demand side from the economies of the US, eurozone and China,"" said Julian Jessop, head of commodities research at Capital Economics.

1410,most asian markets up tokyo at 15 year hig,"Hong Kong: Japanese shares hit a 15-year high Wednesday after the country recorded its first trade surplus in three years, while the euro weakened on growing concerns that Greece will not reach a bailout reform deal with its creditors.With few catalysts to spur business in Asia, other markets were mostly higher despite a broadly negative lead from Wall Street.Tokyo rallied 1.11 percent, Hong Kong gained 0.12 percent and Shanghai put on 0.26 percent while Seoul added 0.72 percent. Sydney slipped 0.58 percent.Tokyo´s Nikkei broke back through the 20,000 point barrier -- after briefly clearing the hurdle earlier this month -- as the yen slipped against the dollar.Before the market opened the finance ministry said March saw the country enjoy its first trade surplus since June 2012 thanks to tumbling oil prices and a boost in exports.However, economists warned the positive results might not last.""We expect the yen to weaken further in coming months, which should lift the cost of imports by more than the yen-value of exports,"" Marcel Thieliant at Capital Economics wrote in a commentary.""The trade balance is unlikely to remain in surplus for long.""The dollar was at 119.68 yen against 119.63 yen in New York and well up from 119.44 yen in Tokyo earlier Tuesday.The dollar´s strength comes despite the diminishing likelihood of a US rate hike by the US Federal Reserve soon.""More and more the expectation is that the Fed won´t do anything soon. The momentum in equities is still there,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist at IG in Melbourne, told Bloomberg News.The euro slipped as investors nervously follow events in Europe as Greece struggles to scrape cash together to pay its bills.Athens is facing a backlash from the country´s mayors after it issued a decree ordering them to hand over their reserves in order to service its debts and pay wages.The government is locked in negotiations with its international creditors on unlocking some billions of euros in much-needed bailout funds. Failure to secure the cash will likely see it default and possibly crash out of the eurozone, which analysts fear could have global repercussions.Greece´s creditors sounded the alarm Saturday over the pace of debt negotiations, with European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi saying: ""More work, much more work is needed now, and it´s urgent.""The euro slipped to $1.0721 and 128.33 yen from $1.0735 and 128.42 yen in US trade.On Wall Street the Dow fell 0.47 percent and the S&P 500 slipped 0.15 percent but the Nasdaq added 0.39 percent.The next focus for investors is the release Thursday of HSBC´s preliminary report on activity in China´s manufacturing sector, which will give the latest indication about the state of the world´s number two economy.Oil prices were lower.

West Texas Intermediate for May delivery sank $1.12, or two percent, to close at $55.26 a barrel on its last day the contract´s trade on the New York Mercantile Exchange.Brent North Sea crude for June delivery, the global benchmark, settled at $62.08 a barrel in London trade, down $1.37 (2.2 percent) from Monday´s closing level.News of the Saudi-led coalition wrapping up air strikes against rebels in Yemen, coming in afternoon trade in New York, accelerated losses on the market, said Phil Flynn of Price Futures Group.""Oil is selling because the Saudis are going to end their operation in Yemen,"" Flynn said. ""This is why we´ve seen the precipitous drop in prices in the last few minutes.""The end of four weeks of air strikes against the Huthi rebel forces, with the coalition saying the rebels´ threat to Saudi Arabia and neighboring countries had been removed, eased concerns about the spreading unrest in Yemen.Although Yemen is not a particularly important oil producer, market watchers have been worried about the impact of the turmoil on the oil-rich region, notably in Iran, which is suspected of supporting the rebellion.Expectations for Wednesday´s weekly inventories report from the US Department of Energy were bearish. The country´s historically high crude inventories were estimated to have increased by 2.5 million barrels in the week ended April 17, according to a Bloomberg News survey of experts.Oil prices have shed about half their value since last June amid a supply glut and weak demand growth.For many analysts, recent gains in oil prices were mainly the result of speculative buying by investors betting that the fundamentals of supply and demand would improve. News last week of a slight decline in US oil production had boosted prices.""There is no fundamental explanation for the price spike,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a research note Tuesday. ""Due to sharply higher OPEC oil production, the market remains significantly oversupplied."" (AFP)

1418,us oil production important amid clean energy transition ob,"WASHINGTON: President Barack Obama Thursday called US oil production an important source of energy as America transitions towards cleaner resources, defending his move to allow petroleum giant Shell to drill in the Alaskan Arctic.Obama´s administration gave the petroleum giant a green light three days ago to explore the Chukchi Sea near Alaska -- as long as the Anglo-Dutch firm has the correct permits from the agencies that regulate the environment and marine mammal health.Environmental groups oppose the drilling due to the vulnerability of Arctic animals that are already struggling with melting sea ice and the risk that an oil spill would pose to the region.""Despite the fact that Shell had put in an application for exploration in this region several years ago, we delayed it for a very lengthy period of time, until they could provide us with the kinds of assurances that we have not seen before,"" Obama said during a Thursday press conference.Shell put its drilling plans for the Alaska Arctic on hold in 2013 following multiple embarrassing problems with its two rigs.One, the Kulluk, washed ashore after breaking loose from towing vessels in stormy seas in southern Alaska in January.Another, the Noble Discoverer, was recently cited by the US Coast Guard for numerous safety and operational deficiencies.Both rigs were sent to Asia for repair and maintenance work.""Shell had to go back to the drawing board, revamp its approach,"" Obama said.""I am working internationally to reduce our carbon emissions and to replace, over time, fossil fuels with clean energies,"" he added.""In the meantime, we are going to continue to be using fossil fuels, and when it can be done safely and appropriately, US production of oil and natural gas is important,"" Obama said.He added that importing oil and gas meant it might be ""purchased from places that have much lower environmental standards than we do.""Some Americans grew increasingly wary of drilling after the April 2010 explosion of BP-leased Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf of Mexico, which killed 11 people and spewed 4.9 million barrels of oil into the ocean.A Shell spokesman said that operations in the Chukchi Sea are scheduled to begin in the coming months.

I don't think anyone has. Liquidity is totally depleted,"" said Du Changchun, an analyst at Northeast Securities.""Originally, many wanted to hold blue chips. But since so many small caps are suspended from trading, the only way to reduce risk exposure is to sell blue chips.""More than 30 percent has been knocked off the value of Chinese shares since mid-June, and for some global investors the fear that China's market turmoil will destabilise the real economy is now a bigger risk than the crisis in Greece.""Also, the ripple effect from the market correction has yet to show up,"" wrote Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts in a note. ""We expect slower growth, poorer corporate earnings, and a higher risk of a financial crisis.""Commodities markets reflected growing concerns about the broader health of the world's second largest economy, with copper prices falling to a six-year low, Shanghai nickel futures sliding by their 5 percent daily limit, and oil falling towards $56 a barrel, near a three month-low.TRADING HALTSMore than 500 China-listed firms announced trading halts on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges on Wednesday, taking total suspensions to about 1,300 - 45 percent of the market or roughly $2.4 trillion worth of stock - as companies scuttled to sit out the carnage.With so many small-cap companies sheltering on the sidelines, the ChiNext growth board, which has seen some of the biggest swings in valuations, fell a modest 0.8 percent.The plunge in China's previously booming stock markets, which had more than doubled in the year to mid-June, is a major headache for President Xi Jinping and China's top leaders, who are already grappling with slowing growth.Beijing's interventionist response has also raised questions about its ability to enact the market liberalisation steps that are a centrepiece of its economic reform agenda.China has orchestrated brokerages and fund managers to promise to buy billions of dollars' worth of stocks, helped by a state-backed margin finance company which the central bank pledged on Wednesday to provide sufficient liquidity.The securities regulator said the Securities Finance Corp had provided 260 billion yuan ($41.8 billion) to 21 brokerages, though that sum is only 40 percent of the amount of leveraged positions that investors have cut since June 18.RETAIL INVESTORSUnlike other major stock markets, which are dominated by professional money managers, retail investors account for around 85 percent of China trade, which exacerbates volatility.""It's uncommon to see so many shares posting consecutive daily limit falls, and the index futures swinging so wildly,"" said Wang Feng, CEO and founder of hedge fund firm Alpha Squared Capital Co and a former Wall Street trader.""It's a stampede. And the problem of the market is that all the players move in the same direction, and are too emotional.""A surprise interest-rate cut by the central bank at the end of June, relaxations in margin trading and other ""stability measures"" have done little to calm investors.The barrage of official commentary and new support measures continued throughout Wednesday's trading session, without visible effect.Deng Ge, a spokesman for the China Securities Regulatory Commission, said in remarks posted on its official channel on Weibo, China's version of Twitter, that there had been a big increase in ""irrational selling"" of stocks.Government agencies also announced that insurers would be allowed to by more blue chips and urged major shareholders and top executives to buy their own shares.But the market sell-off has extended beyond the mainland, with Chinese stocks on US exchanges falling as much as 6.1 percent on Tuesday, according to the Bank of New York Mellon index of such securities.Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index fell 5.8 percent, with shares of Chinese brokerages taking a heavy beating.""Investors are extremely unimpressed with their sudden conscription into national service, and you can see that in their share prices,"" said Matthew Smith, a strategist who covers the China financials sector for Macquarie.

The 2016 forecast was for a pick-up to 3.8 percent.""Moderate growth continues, with an improving recovery in advanced economies, and a slowdown in underlying growth in emerging-market and low-income developing economies,"" said Olivier Blanchard, the IMF´s chief economist, at a news conference.According to the IMF, the downgrade of the global growth forecast largely reflects the contraction in the US economy in the first quarter amid severe winter weather, which spilled over to neighboring Canada and Mexico.""The unexpected weakness in North America, which accounts for the lion´s share of the growth forecast revision in advanced economies, is likely to prove a temporary setback,"" it said.Because of the setback, the IMF lowered its forecast for the United States, the world´s largest economy, by 0.6 percentage point to 2.5 percent. Canada´s forecast was cut by 0.7 point to 1.5 percent, and Mexico´s by 0.6 point to 2.4 percent.Blanchard said that the US economy´s soft first quarter, a 0.2 percent contraction, turned out to not be a sign of underlying weakness ""now that the fog has largely cleared.""""Fundamentals are still solid, and the US recovery is on track,"" he said.Greece´s debt crisis, which could force it to abandon the euro, for the moment only was having a marginal effect on the expansion of the global economy, the IMF said in the update of its World Economic Outlook.The institution left unchanged its forecasts for the eurozone at 1.5 percent, and for the two largest economies: Germany (1.6 percent) and France (1.2 percent).""Developments in Greece have, so far, not resulted in any significant contagion. Timely policy action should help to manage such risks if they were to materialize,"" it said, noting the recovery in the eurozone seemed ""broadly on track"".But the recent rise in interest rates on the sovereign bonds in some euro area economies could signal larger problems ahead. ""Some risks of a reemergence of financial stress remain,"" it said.- China outlook unchanged -The 188-nation IMF also left unchanged its forecast for China (6.8 percent) despite the turbulence in its capital markets.""The puncture of what had clearly become a stock market bubble may have some limited effect on spending. But, for the moment, the slowdown in growth is primarily led by a slowdown in real estate investment, a development we see as basically desirable,"" Blanchard said.""There is no particular reason to have lost confidence"" in China´s economy because of the bursting bubble, he added.Japan, the world´s number-three economy, had some drag from sluggish consumption and wage growth, the IMF said, lowering its forecast by 0.2 point to 0.8 percent.Slowing growth in emerging market and developing economies was also holding back momentum in the global economy.The IMF said the contraction in Brazil, Latin America´s largest economy, would be worse than previously thought; it expects the economy to shrink by 1.5 percent this year.But the outlook for Russia, also in recession, was improved, with a 3.4 percent contraction expected after improvements in commodity prices and confidence.Risks to growth remained tilted to the downside, it said, including spillovers to economic activity from heightened geopolitical tensions in Ukraine, the Middle East and Africa.Given these uncertainties, the IMF was waiting for better growth in 2016, estimated at 3.8 percent, but showed caution.""The projected pickup in global growth, while still expected, has not yet firmly materialized,"" it said.

1430,oil prices finish higher after iran d,"LONDON: Oil prices rose Tuesday as markets weighed the effects of Iran´s deal with six world powers on curbing the Islamic republic´s suspected ambitions for a nuclear bomb.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery gained 84 cents at $53.04 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.European benchmark Brent oil for August delivery added 66 cents at $58.51 a barrel in London. ""I think people had already sold down the price of oil, expecting an agreement,"" said Michael Lynch, an analyst with the US-based consultancy Strategic Energy & Economic Research. ""So it´s a case of selling on the rumour and buying on the news.""""Now that it´s actually happened, people are buying back in,"" Lynch said.Analysts said the landmark agreement that will see sanctions eventually lifted on Iran´s oil exports would help to put a lid on any rise in crude futures this year and in the future.""To be clear, the return of Iranian oil exports over the next year is one factor likely to keep oil prices low,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at consultants Capital Economics.Historic dealMajor powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- clinched a historic deal Tuesday aimed at ensuring Iran does not obtain the nuclear bomb, opening up Tehran´s stricken economy and potentially ending decades of bad blood with the West.Reached on day 18 of marathon talks in Vienna, the accord is aimed at resolving a 13-year standoff over Iran´s nuclear ambitions after repeated diplomatic failures and threats of military action.The deal puts strict limits on Iran´s nuclear activities for at least a decade and calls for stringent UN oversight, with world powers hoping that this will make any dash to make an atomic bomb virtually impossible.In return, painful international sanctions that have slashed the oil exports of OPEC´s fifth-largest producer and choked its economy will be lifted and billions of dollars in frozen assets unblocked.However, analysts cautioned that it will take time for additional Iranian oil to hit markets.""Iranian crude oil production is likely to increase in 2016 but will take a number of years to reach its previous peak,"" Fitch Ratings said in a client note on Tuesday.""Iran´s oil exports at the moment are around 1.1 million barrels per day versus levels of around 2.5 million before 2012,"" it noted.The ratings agency added: ""We would expect to see some increases in production throughout the course of 2016 but that this would be less than half of the full 1.4 million barrels daily that was lost.""The remainder will require significant investment and expertise, for which Iran is likely to want to partner with international oil companies.""A spokesperson for Royal Dutch Shell said the energy giant is ""interested in exploring the role Shell can play in developing Iran´s energy potential"".BP added in a statement: ""We are watching the situation and in the meantime we continue to comply with sanctions. We will look at opportunities once able to do so.""Lid on pricesLooking ahead, ""the extent of the impact on oil prices will depend primarily on the domestic capability to get oil on the market"", said Nina Skero, economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research.""We expect Brent crude to... trade around $60 per barrel for the remainder of the year,"" she added.World oil prices collapsed by 60 per cent between June 2014 and January when it hit a low of $45. This in part was owing to excessive supplies caused by the boom in US shale oil.While OPEC on Monday revised upward its forecast for global crude oil demand growth for this year, it warned that crude output would also continue to increase.Iran´s OPEC peers Saudi Arabia and Iraq ""have both significantly ramped up production this year"", noted Richard Mallinson, analyst at research group Energy Aspects.""There is little chance that these countries, and other OPEC members, are going to reduce output to make space for a return of Iranian production,"" he told AFP.

1431,asian shares mixed dollar pushes higher,"Tokyo: Asian shares were mixed Tuesday morning with Tokyo buoyed by a weak yen but falling commodity prices raised fears about global growth as Chinese stocks slipped after a brief reprieve in their month-long rout.Tokyo´s benchmark Nikkei 225 index rose 0.43 percent, Hong Kong was up 0.23 percent, Seoul was flat, Sydney gained 0.14 percent, while Singapore edged down 0.06 percent.Chinese shares fell sharply at the open as investors grew cautious after the market approached the key 4,000-point level, dealers said.The benchmark Shanghai Composite Index dropped 1.64 percent while the Shenzhen Composite Index, which tracks stocks on China´s second exchange, lost 1.91 percent.Both indices moved back into positive territory in later trading. The fresh volatility comes after Beijing launched a series of initiatives to staunch a bloodletting that saw a 30 percent plunge in Shanghai and trillions wiped off valuations.Among the measures were a police crackdown on short-selling and a ban on big shareholders and company executives from selling stock for six months, adding to earlier announcements.Meanwhile, dealers said a drop in commodities prices raised concerns about the global economy as crude oil briefly fell below $50 a barrel on Tuesday, and gold traded near a five-year low.""This commodities rout is a very big concern,"" Michael McCarthy, a chief strategist at CMC Markets in Sydney, told Bloomberg News. ""There´s risk for a further downside. It looks like the overall global growth outlook is continuing to slow.""Investors were also keeping an eye on Greece where the government hiked taxes and paid billions of euros to its creditors on Monday, as banks reopened just days after the debt-laden country reached a bailout deal with its creditors.In currency markets, the dollar was trading around a five-week high at 124.34 yen, against 124.30 yen in New York on Monday.The euro bought $1.0825 and 134.61 yen, little changed from $1.0824 and 134.55 yen in US trading.""The weaker yen and cheaper oil will have a positive effect on Japanese stocks,"" said Toshihiko Matsuno, chief strategist at SMBC Friend Securities Co. in Tokyo.Eyes are now on Washington as the Federal Reserve considers when to hike interest rates from their record lows as the US economy gets back up to speed. Last week Fed chief Janet Yellen said she saw a rise taking place before 2016 -- a rate hike is a plus for the dollar.Meanwhile, the Bank of Japan and European Central Bank are spending hundreds of billions of dollars on bonds and other assets to support their respective economies, pushing down the value of the yen and euro.On oil markets, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was down 10 cents to $50.05, after briefly dipping to $49.94, and Brent crude for September fell eight cents to $56.57 a barrel in morning Asian trade.Gold fetched $1,103.54 after falling as low as $1,072 per ounce in Asia trade Monday.

1433,gold slides towards 5 year ,"LONDON: Gold fell back towards five-year lows on Wednesday as investors continued to pull away from the precious metal, with a slide through key chart levels earlier this week setting prices up for further losses.A looming rise in US interest rates, the first in nearly a decade, has dented gold's investment appeal, encouraging more sellers in the market after Monday's 3 percent rout, its biggest one-day drop since September 2013.Holdings in top gold-backed exchange-traded fund (ETF) SPDR Gold Trust fell for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining another 4.8 tonnes to hit their lowest since 2008. Its reserves have nearly halved from their 2012 peak.Spot gold was down 0.5 percent at $1,095.69 an ounce at 0940 GMT, while US gold futures for August delivery were down $8.70 an ounce at $1,094.80. On Monday, gold slid to its lowest since March 2009 at $1,088.05 an ounce.It failed to benefit from a softer tone to the dollar and stock markets on Wednesday, which usually would be expected to give some respite to the metal.""We expect further losses in gold,"" Commerzbank analyst Daniel Briesemann said. ""Gold prices are falling against the weaker dollar, declining equity markets -- those are clearly bad signs. Everything speaks against rising gold prices.""ETF investors are getting rid of their holdings, and it seems speculators are also continuing to sell. It's a perfect storm for gold,"" he said. ""Expectations about the developments of US interest rates are clearly an underlying trend.""Monday's selloff came on the back of huge volumes traded on the Shanghai Gold Exchange after investors dumped more than $500 million of bullion in New York in four seconds during early Asian trading hours.That sparked a slide through key chart levels, triggering stop-loss orders that added to momentum. From a technical perspective, gold remains under pressure.""Our next price target is seen at $1,044, the 2010 low, followed by $1,006, the late 2009 high,"" technical analysts at ScotiaMocatta said in a note. ""Lower lows and lower highs keep this bearish price move in motion. Only a close back above $1,133 will stabilize the metal.""Physical demand has been sluggish despite this week's steep price drop. India is not rushing to pick up slack Chinese demand as would-be buyers wait for further price drops, with a wedding season lull and poor rains curbing appetite.Spot platinum was down 0.9 percent at $968.95 an ounce, while palladium was down 1.1 percent at $618.90, both trading near multi-year lows.

Tokyo shed 1.07 percent, Sydney was 0.89 percent lower and Seoul retreated 0.83 percent.Chinese investors rushed for the exit Monday as more data showing the economy still struggling mixed with fears that government measures to prevent a market crash -- including providing vast sums of cash to support shares -- will not last.The moves -- introduced after a more than 30 percent dive that wiped trillions off valuations in just under four weeks -- had been credited with helping to stem the bleeding, stabilise trading and put prices back on an upward trajectory. The market had surged more than 150 percent in the year to hitting a near-term peak on June 12.Tuesday´s losses came despite assurances from Beijing that it will unleash more cash to provide stability to jittery share markets.State-backed China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), which has reportedly already pumped billions of yuan into mainland equities under a government plan, will continue to buy stocks, the state-run Xinhua news agency reported. - Return of volatility -""The worst time has passed but we think there is a final leg for this correction,"" Steve Yang, strategist at UBS Group AG, said.

It puts us in a unique position among global news providers,"" said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive of the New York Times Company.""We believe that no other news organisation has achieved digital subscriber numbers like ours or comparable digital subscription revenue.

Digital advertising pulled in $48.3 million, or 32.5 percent, of total ad revenues for the quarter ending June 30.Digital ad growth ""was again driven by growth in mobile, paid posts and video,"" Thompson said.""Expense management will remain a top priority as we head into the second half of 2015, although our emphasis on digital investment and execution is also more intense than ever.""Thompson said he expects to boost readership through partnerships recently announced with Facebook and Starbucks.

Brent crude for October, a new contract, was down 65 cents to $48.54.WTI and Brent´s September contract rose in New York on Friday after closing at their lowest level in six and a half years in the prior session.But oil came under renewed pressure in Asia after the latest data showing the number of rigs drilling for US oil increased last week, the sixth rise in seven weeks, analysts said.The news added to fears of a prolonged global surplus as output from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and the United States remains robust despite the tumbling prices.""The combination of elevated stockpiles in the US and increasing production from OPEC, sluggish demand growth, and a stronger US (dollar) would continue to pressure oil prices,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar strengthened in Asia on Monday after solid data boosted expectations of an imminent US rate rise, after China´s shock devaluation of the yuan last week hurt Asia-Pacific currencies.As oil is traded in the US currency, a strong dollar makes it more expensive for international investors, dampening demand.""The devaluation of the yuan by China led to the weakening of other emerging market currencies,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.""This spells negative news for crude as a strong US dollar makes crude expensive for importing countries, thereby curtailing demand.""Gupta said traders will be watching Chinese home prices data due for release Tuesday for further clues on the health of the world´s second-largest economy.Traders will also comb through the minutes of the US central bank´s meeting in late July, due for release Wednesday, for signs on when the Fed will raise interest rates.""We continue to expect further short-term downside in WTI crude over the next few months,"" the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group (ANZ) said in a market commentary.

1444,buzzfeed gets 200m expansion cash with nbcuniversal tie u,"WASHINGTON: BuzzFeed, the website which lives off viral and ""shareable"" news, got a major boost for expansion plans Tuesday with a $200 million investment from NBCUniversal.The deal with NBCU, a division of the media and cable conglomerate Comcast, calls for ""strategic partnerships"" between the two groups, which could allow sharing of content between BuzzFeed and the vast NBC television operations.The deal values the ""social news"" pioneer at some $1.5 billion, according to several media reports. The companies did not comment on the valuation terms of the investment.""It´s a fascinating time for the media industry; social, mobile, digital, and broadcast platforms are converging to create new opportunities to connect with global audiences,"" said Jonah Peretti, BuzzFeed´s founder and chief executive.The news comes just a week after NBCUniversal announced a similar $200 million injection into another digital news group, Vox Media, and highlights the potential seen in online news as consumers move away from traditional media.""BuzzFeed has built an exceptional global company that harmonizes technology, data and superior editorial abilities to create and share content in innovative ways,"" said Steve Burke, CEO at NBCUniversal.""They reach a massive, loyal audience and have proven to be among the most creative, popular and influential new media players. We are pleased to be making this investment and for our companies to partner and work together.""The investment follows Monday´s announcement that BuzzFeed would launch a Japanese news website in a partnership with Yahoo Japan, the latest step in a global expansion push.BuzzFeed is one of the largest pure-play digital websites, claiming to reach some 200 million users worldwide.With its recent expansion, the group says some 45 percent of traffic now comes from outside the United States, having launched editions in Britain, Brazil, France, Australia, India, Germany, Mexico and Canada.BuzzFeed, founded in 2006 by Huffington Post co-founder Peretti, was known for offbeat ""shareable"" news but has been investing in new staff and technology as it expands globally.NBCU was created as a joint venture with the NBC broadcast group and Universal Pictures, previously controlled by France´s Vivendi. Comcast took full control of NBCU in 2013.- Profiting from sharing -While BuzzFeed´s finances are not made public, documents leaked last week by the website Gawker suggested it is making a profit -- some $2.7 million in the first six months of 2014 and $7 million in 2013.Rebecca Lieb, an independent media consultant and analyst, said BuzzFeed ""has successfully captured mass eyeballs, which is difficult in an era of highly specialised and topical information.""BuzzFeed ""is good at picking topics which are light and entertaining and shareable,"" Lieb told AFP.Additionally, she said BuzzFeed has successfully reached younger audiences who often don´t read newspapers or subscribe to cable television, and that this group is attractive to advertisers.BuzzFeed also has been able to optimise its content by using algorithms that show which stories are viewed and shared most often, and prioritising these items, Lieb said.She added that the website is strong in ""native"" advertising, which includes ""sponsored"" and similar content.The tie-up with NBCU offers potential, Lieb said, such as snippets of Olympic videos which could be offered to BuzzFeed and drive consumers to watch more on television.Kenneth Lerer, BuzzFeed´s executive chairman, said in a statement that the tie-up could mean ""collaborating on television content, movies, the Olympics, and joint partnerships with ad agencies and brands.""Last year, BuzzFeed said it had secured $50 million in a deal that reportedly valued it at $850 million. But the latest injection vaults it into the club of ""unicorns,"" a term used for startups valued at over $1 billion.Vox is believed to be worth over $1 billion following its recent cash infusion from NBCU. And Vice Media last year secured some $500 million which boosted its valuation to a reported $2.5 billion.One of the largest digital-only news groups is the Huffington Post, whose future is uncertain after its parent company AOL was sold this year to telecom giant Verizon.

1445,oil prices fall ahead of us stocks d,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday, giving up meagre gains in the previous session as investors await a US inventory report to gauge demand in the world´s top economy.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for September delivery fell 17 cents to $42.45 a barrel and Brent crude for October dipped 23 cents to $48.58 a barrel in late-morning Asian trade.Both contracts eked out modest rebounds in closing deals in New York on Tuesday.But analysts said prices were unlikely to stage a sustained rally because the market remains awash with supplies from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), led by Saudi Arabia.Oil traders are also watching a report on US crude inventories in the week ending August 14 due later Wednesday to measure demand in the world´s biggest economy and large producer of shale oil.Analysts expect inventories to decline, but also said stockpile levels remain high after a weaker-than-hoped rise in demand during the summer driving season.""Output in the US has turned out to be more robust than many had previously assumed, as shale firms have dramatically slashed costs and increased their efficiency rather than cutting production,"" said Thomas Pugh, commodities economist at research firm Capital Economics.Demand growth is not keeping pace with supply, especially with the slowdown in China, the world´s top energy consuming nation and its second-biggest economy.Iran last month also reached an agreement with major world powers to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for the lifting of crippling Western economic sanctions which have restricted its oil exports.""This renewed decline in oil prices has largely been driven by a combination of concerns about demand, notably from China, and continued strong growth in supply,"" said Pugh.""OPEC has increased its output by almost 1.4 million barrels per day since January and the potential return of exports from Iran early next year could exacerbate the supply glut,"" he said.

Money is flowing into digital news ventures at an unprecedented pace, as investors anticipate an accelerating shift away from traditional media, and new ways to generate revenue from news.BuzzFeed made news this past week with a $200 million capital injection from Comcast´s NBCUniversal, and with the announcement of a joint venture with Yahoo Japan for Japanese readers.Earlier this month, Vox Media also secured $200 million from NBCU as the startup seeks to ramp up its news websites including Vox.com, The Verge, Re/code and Bleacher Report.Vox and BuzzFeed joined the club of ""unicorns,"" or venture-funded startups worth at least $1 billion, a group which also includes Vice Media, which unveiled a $500 million funding round last year.The flood of capital to the sector suggests confidence in the ability of digital media to connect with readers -- especially younger audiences which eschew traditional media -- and generate profits, say analysts.""Right now it´s an arms race. These are companies growing quickly and they have to grow quickly,"" said Ken Doctor, a media analyst with the research firm Outsell.Doctor said a key for these organization is capturing the attention of ""millennials,"" or young adults born after 1980 who rarely subscribe to print publications or cable television, and who get most of their content online.""Marketers have discovered the millennial generation as they get more earning power,"" he told AFP.Interestingly, much of the money flowing into these organizations is coming from traditional media, seeking fresh ways to deal with a transition to digital news.The Murdoch family´s 21st Century Fox is an investor in Vice Media, for example, while Time Warner has invested in the online news site Mashable.""It´s as much a hedge as anything else,"" Doctor said.""It´s a lot of money but not a bank-breaking amount.""Digital eats everything The analyst added that big media groups which saw troubles for print a decade ago are now waking up to digital disruption of television.With consumers slowly moving away from cable TV bundles, ""you can see the fault lines,"" Doctor said. ""Digital eats everything, and television is not immune.""The more successful media startups have found ways to connect and use technology better than legacy firms, say some analysts.""BuzzFeed and Vox and other high-profile startups make the claim they are not just content companies, they are tech companies,"" says Nikki Usher Layser, a journalism professor at George Washington University specializing in digital media.This means ""using data science to understand how information is spreading"" and being shared, she said, to better adapt news feeds and enable advertisers to reach specific segments of readers.BuzzFeed is known for using technology to help understand how news goes viral, while Mashable uses its own system for this. AOL, which owns news sites such as The Huffington Post and TechCrunch, is known for ad technology which measures effectiveness of online messages. Old, new media mergeRebecca Lieb, an independent media analyst and consultant, said she sees benefits from bringing old and new media together.Comcast´s NBC can reach young audiences by sharing video from programming including the Olympic Games.""We´re seeing an era of declining television viewership and increased cord cutting,"" she told AFP.""We have a large number of millennials who are never going to sign up for television packages so I´m sure NBC is hoping that BuzzFeed can help drive new audiences.""For journalism, the good news is that this trend is driving investment in content, which means more hiring and in-depth reporting at a time when traditional newsroom job losses are accelerating.These large venture-funded news groups have been adding staff, along with smaller ones like Ozy, Fusion and Vocativ. Additionally, eBay founder Pierre Omidyar has pledged to invest $250 million in his online news operations, which include investigative site The Intercept.Doctor said most new media groups spend 60 to 70 percent of their budgets on news and content compared with just 12 percent for the newspaper industry.""These companies have a belief that good content and appropriate content is a business driver,"" Doctor said.Still, it remains unclear if the companies are seeing an investment bubble which gives them unjustifiably high valuations.""We have seen scant evidence of actual return of money to investors,"" Layser said. ""We have not seen a magic bullet that is going to make a clear pathway to profitability.""

1447,shanghai leads rout in asian ,"HONG KONG: Asian stocks sank deeper into crisis Monday, with Shanghai posting its largest intra-day fall since 2007 as growing concerns about China´s slowing economy rattled equity investors worldwide. Oil prices fell further after slipping below $40 a barrel for the first time in six years, as weak Chinese manufacturing data deepened worries about the slowdown in the world´s number two economy.China-linked shares led the falls, with Shanghai losing more than 8.50 percent at one point before recovering slightly to a 7.52 percent decline in afternoon trading -- wiping out all this year´s gains. Hong Kong was down 4.77 percent.Tokyo closed down 4.61 percent, or 895.15 points, at a six-month low of 18,540.68. Seoul dropped 2.47 percent or 46.26 points to 1,829.81 and Sydney lost 4.09 percent, or 213.3 points, to finish at a two-year low of 5,001.3.Regional shares, as measured by the MSCI Asia Pacific Index, slumped to a two-year low Monday after suffering the worst week for three years. Taipei posted its worst ever intra-day slump of almost 7.50 percent.""Today has all the hallmarks of being one of the worst trading days of the past five years,"" said Evan Lucas at IG Markets.""The reaction from Asia today will be symptomatic of the current investor sentiment and belief that a hard landing (of China´s economy) is inevitable.""Asia´s losses followed a steep fall in US and European stocks on Friday, while the price of several commodities plunged to multi-year lows and emerging market currencies took a battering. Global equities have lost more than $5 trillion in value since China´s shock currency devaluation on August 11 sparked fears its economy is slowing more than thought. Data on Friday showing Chinese manufacturing activity slowed to a 77-month low added to the gloom, signalling that even a campaign by Beijing to stimulate growth by cutting interest rates and boosting lending is not working. Pension fund buying equitiesMore than 750 stocks listed in Shanghai fell by their maximum 10 percent daily limit on Monday, among them many of the brokerages which helped to spark a year-long rally that saw shares soar 150 percent before they collapsed in June. Chinese authorities have since launched unprecedented measures to support shares. On Sunday state media said the huge national pension fund would now be allowed to buy equities, in a fresh bid to prop up the market. The fund, which had some 3.5 trillion yuan ($550 billion) in net assets at the end of 2014, will be able to invest up to 30 percent of that in equities.But local investors fear even Beijing´s huge firepower will not be enough to stop the rout in Chinese shares, particularly after Shanghai shares fell through the key 3,500 point mark.""This is a real disaster and it seems nothing can stop it,"" Chen Gang, Shanghai-based chief investment officer at Heqitongyi Asset Management Co., told Bloomberg News.""If we don´t cut holdings ourselves, the fund (managed by his firm) faces risk of forced closure. Many newly started private funds suffered that recently. I hope we can survive.""Oil prices also fell, after breaking below the $40 barrel for the first time in six years Friday on concerns about waning demand in China, the world´s top energy importer.Data showing the number of US drilling rigs rose last week, despite the slump in prices, added to concerns a global supply glut will last for years.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery fell $1.28 to $39.58 while Brent crude for October eased $1.45 to $44.65.Jitters over China and the global economy saw traders drop the dollar and move into the yen -- a safe haven in times of turmoil and uncertainty -- while the currencies of Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea all hit fresh multi-year lows.The greenback fell to 121.23 yen in Asia Monday, down from 122.06 yen in New York Friday.

A reading below 50 signifies contraction in activity.The poor data fuelled concerns about the world´s second-largest economy and top energy importer -- already heightened by Beijing´s unexpected devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago -- at a time when high production levels and weak demand growth are weighing on prices.Oil dealers will next be scrutinising preliminary US second-quarter GDP data to be released on Thursday, analysts said.The data could be key to the Federal Reserve´s timeline for raising interest rates, with predictions for a September raise fading in the face of global growth jitters.Interest rate adjustments are closely watched by crude investors as an increase usually leads to a pick-up in the dollar. A stronger greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies, denting demand.

Capital Economics said investors had been ""overreacting about economic risks in China"", arguing that the ""collapse of the equity bubble tells us next to nothing about the state of China's economy"".'Step up'Chinese shares have been on a roller-coaster ride after a year-long debt-fuelled rally collapsed in mid-June, prompting the government to unleash a vast support package that has included using state vehicles to support the market.In the latest move, Beijing said on Sunday it would allow the state pension fund, which had 3.5 trillion yuan of assets at the end of 2014, to buy stocks.But mainland investors are worried that support could start to taper and they are now waiting to see if the ""national team"" will intervene further, or China´s central bank will loosen monetary policy.The People´s Bank of China, the central bank, said on Tuesday it had injected 150 billion yuan ($23 billion) into the money market to ease tight liquidity.

Pakistans national flag was also flashed across the screen. It is an honour to represent Pakistan at the NASDAQ opening bell ceremony as part of our Independence Day celebrations from the platform of the Pakistan American Business Association (PABA) which is doing an excellent job to promote Pakistan-US business ties through private sector cooperation, Dr. Lodhi said before pressing the button to set off the bell.Our economy has staged an impressive recovery while our security situation is improving by the day, she said, adding that, Our economic reforms and liberalisation policies have placed us on a trajectory to achieve higher economic growth. Pakistan has a functioning democracy, an independent judiciary, and a free and lively media. Our hardworking and enterprising overseas Pakistanis are not only making a mark in their countries of adoption but sending back remittances which are at a record level today. Our strategic location gives Pakistan a pivotal role in promoting regional connectivity. Plans are underway to make Pakistan a regional economic hub providing trade energy and communication corridors linking Central Asia to South and South West Asia and beyond.Earlier, top officials of NASDAQ, Andew Hall and David Wicks congratulated the government and people of Pakistan after Hall introduced Ambassador Lodhi.The Chairman of PABA, M. Siddique Sheikh, President of PABA, Keith Segerson, and active member Sajjad Qamar were among those present at the ceremony which was also attended by Pakistan Consul General Raja Ali Ejaz.This years Independence Day coincides with a remarkable recovery in Pakistans economy. This is a very exciting time for Pakistan to attract foreign investment and for the US based companies to benefit from lucrative incentives this country offers. PABA is ideally poised to work as a bridge between the private sectors of the two countries, Segerson said in a statement.

1454,japan iran to start investment talks next ,"Tokyo: Japan and Iran will start talks next week to negotiate a bilateral investment treaty, as Washington moves to ease sanctions against Tehran and Tokyo looks to step up its interests in the resource rich nation.Japanese and Iranian officials will meet in Tehran from Monday through to Wednesday to secure a deal, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga said Friday, as other energy consumers also rush to explore Tehran´s commercial potential.""The aim of these negotiations is to protect the investment activities of Japanese companies,"" Suga told reporters at a regular briefing.When asked how resource-poor Japan would tap Iran´s energy potential, Suga said: ""Keeping those various factors in mind, Japan will take the necessary steps and not be later than other nations.""The move comes as Washington secures support in Congress for its nuclear deal with Iran, designed to limit its nuclear programme in exchange for the easing of US-led international sanctions.The historic deal was clinched in July after two years of negotiations to address Western concerns that Iran was developing a nuclear bomb -- a claim Iran denies.Japan hopes the lifting of sanctions will lead to increased auto exports to Iran and more Iranian energy imports, although Tokyo officials are bracing themselves for fierce international competition for market access, local media reported. Tokyo, which is heavily dependent on Middle Eastern oil, has maintained friendly relations with Tehran through its years of ostracism, keeping up diplomatic dialogue that many developed countries cut off decades ago.But Tokyo has reduced its Iranian oil imports in recent years under pressure from fellow developed powers backing the US-led sanction regime. There have also been no new Japanese investments in Iran since 1993, according to official data. There were approximately 30 Japanese firms operating in the country as of July last year, data showed.Iran has meanwhile praised Japan´s nuclear technology, even after the 2011 Fukushima crisis, and said more investment in Iran´s atomic sector could boost bilateral relations.Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida is also expected to visit Iran as early as next month to set up a bilateral committee to discuss energy and infrastructure development and other economic issues, Kyodo News said.

1455,asia markets calm after tough week but us rates in focu,"Hong Kong: Asian markets were relatively calm Friday at the end of a volatile week, with Shanghai and Hong Kong ticking higher after China unveiled a series of steps to shore up its economy, but fears of a US interest rate hike kept dealers on edge.Higher-yielding, or riskier, currencies such as the Malaysian ringgit and South Korean won benefited from a more upbeat outlook, which followed a positive lead from Wall Street, while the Australian dollar edged higher.The safe-haven yen, considered a go-to asset in times of turmoil, retreated.Analysts said world markets seemed to be settling after a roller-coaster ride since China last month devalued its yuan currency, sparking concerns about the world´s number two economy -- the main driver of global growth -- and its leaders´ ability to control the crisis.The broadly upbeat sentiment comes after Beijing sought to reassure investors it was able to maintain high growth, and announced a plan to speed up major construction projects and cut taxes for small and medium-sized enterprises.A set of capital controls to prevent a flight of cash were implemented this week, while analysts said a rise in the offshore yuan Thursday suggested the central bank had intervened to prop it up.Authorities also unveiled a series of measures to prevent huge swings in China´s stock markets, which have seen trillions of dollars wiped off valuations in Shanghai since it hit a peak in mid-June. Among the measures are a ""circuit breaker"" that stops shares being traded after rising or falling by a certain amount.In early trade, Shanghai was up 0.29 percent, Hong Kong added 1.31 percent and Sydney was 0.37 percent higher. Tokyo pared most early losses to end the morning flat.Juichi Wako, a senior strategist at Nomura Holdings, told Bloomberg News: ""We seem to be forming a bottom, but uncertainty has yet to be completely dispelled, including what happens with US monetary policy.""Global investors are nervously waiting for next week´s Federal Reserve policy meeting, with uncertainty over whether it will lift interest rates for the first time in nine years or hold fire owing to the recent market turmoil.A hike in borrowing costs would likely hinder investment possibilities and also fan a flight of capital back to the United States in search of better returns, to the detriment of emerging markets.Hopes that bank policymakers will opt not to raise rates supported US stocks, with Wall Street´s three main indexes all ending strongly higher.A less volatile atmosphere saw low-risk assets retreat. The dollar bought 120.82 yen compared with 120.63 yen in New York, while the euro was at $1.1279 compared with $1.1275.And the Australian dollar, which earlier in the week hit a six-year low below 69 US cents, was at 70.72 cents.The ringgit was up 0.13 percent and the won gained 0.82 percent. New Zealand´s dollar, which tanked Thursday after the central bank cut interest rates, edged up 0.3 percent.

The report also said US oil production fell for the sixth straight week.""For the oil market, the fact that US oil production was down once again may perhaps be even more relevant than the decline in stocks,"" said Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch.""This would appear to prove OPEC´s strategy correct, namely that low oil prices would prompt shale oil producers to abandon production. In fact, this trend may well even accelerate in the near future.""World oil prices have roughly halved in value since a year ago, plagued by a global supply glut caused largely by cheaper production of US oil following extraction from shale rock.Attention is now focused on Washington where the Fed will make an announcement on borrowing costs, with analyst opinion split on whether it will begin lift-off of raising rates on Thursday or wait until December.Fed chief Janet Yellen has said she expects an increase in US interest rates by the end of the year but recent turmoil in global markets caused by concerns about China´s economy have complicated policymakers´ decision-making.A rise in US interest rates tends to bolster the dollar, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand.

However, an improved risk tone could cushion oil prices on the downside,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.The dollar climbed after three Federal Reserve presidents put the argument for borrowing costs the rise by year´s end, in a bid to soothe concerns about the global economy that were stoked by the bank´s decision to hold fire Thursday.A strong greenback makes dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.Analysts have said Monday´s strong price rebound looked more like a technical correction from heavy losses last week as the fundamentals of a crude oversupply outrunning demand remained intact.Traders are also closely monitoring progress on Iran´s compliance under a deal with western powers to curb its nuclear ambitions in return for the lifting of sanctions that will allow it to export more oil.On Monday, Iran said it independently collected samples at a suspect military site where illicit nuclear work is alleged to have occurred and later handed them to UN inspectors who were not physically present.In an apparent bid to stave off criticism, the chief of the UN´s International Atomic Energy Agency said ""the integrity of the sampling process and the authenticity of the samples"" was not compromised despite the absence of UN inspectors.

1458,asian stocks currencies sink after china factory d,"Hong Kong: A plunge in a gauge of Chinese factory activity stoked fresh fears about the world´s number two economy and the global outlook Wednesday, sending Asian markets tumbling after a heavy sell-off in New York and Europe.Emerging market currencies -- already under pressure from an expected US interest rate hike and weak growth -- also took a battering as investors rushed into lower-yielding, or safer, assets such as the yen while oil prices eased.The losses extended a general downward spiral across the world as dealers fret over the state of the global economy, with a US recovery offset by China posting growth at 25-year lows, and Japan and the eurozone also struggling.On Wednesday China´s closely watched Purchasing Managers´ Index (PMI) of manufacturing activity for September came in at a six-and-a-half-year low and showed the sector contracted further.The preliminary reading released by financial publisher Caixin came in at 47.0, down from August and missing expectations of 47.5. A result below 50 indicates shrinkage and anything above points to growth.""The decline indicates the nation´s manufacturing industry has reached a crucial stage in the structural transformation process,"" He Fan, chief economist at Caixin Insight Group said in a statement accompanying the figures.He blamed the weakness mainly on sluggish external demand for Chinese goods and lower export prices.The figures come a day after the Asian Development Bank (ABD) said it had lowered its growth expectations for Asia because of the sharp growth slowdown in China, a key driver of global trade.""It´s a confirmation of fears that were existing in the market already that China is in fact doing worse than we had been led to believe and there´s a lot of uncertainty about where that economy really is,"" Emma Lawson, senior currency strategist at National Australia Bank in Sydney, told Bloomberg News.Among Asian stock markets Shanghai sank 0.88 percent, Hong Kong was 1.90 percent lower and Sydney -- where a number of firms with strong China links are listed -- shed 1.70 percent.Seoul, Taipei and Singapore were also each down more than one percent.

""The talks were blocked at some point.""Although the government´s current plans to build Turkish-made missile defence system, it was not immediately clear if Ankara would launch talks with the European and American contenders.Washington was particularly irked by Turkish decision to negotiate with the Chinese company, which has been hit by a series of US sanctions for selling arms and missile technology to Iran and Pakistan.Turkey in the past made confusing comments over its lucrative tender, with a government minister saying the Chinese company was the winner and that its system could be used without integrating with NATO systems.But a spokesman for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan had insisted that the missile system would be harmonious and integrated with NATO defence architecture.

1469,global stocks fall as ecb underwhelms investor,"London: World stock markets churned lower Friday on lingering disappointment over ""underwhelming"" eurozone stimulus measures and ahead of key US jobs data.Equities had plunged Thursday as the European Central Bank´s latest stimulus plan disappointed investors, sparking a global sell off that spilled over into Wall Street and Asia.In late Friday morning deals, London lost another 0.2 percent, Frankfurt fell 0.6 percent and Paris also slid 0.6 percent, one day after the key indices shed between two and four percent in value.Speculation had swirled for weeks that the ECB would ramp up its bond-buying programme and loosen monetary policy to bolster growth and counter weak inflation.Hopes were stoked Wednesday by news that eurozone inflation languished at 0.1 percent in November -- far lower than the ECB´s official 2.0-percent target.The bank on Thursday cut deposit rates further into negative territory -- meaning lenders must pay to park cash with it and so look to loan more -- and extended the length of its bond purchases.- Huge let-down -However, the long-awaited announcement was seen as a huge let-down as it crucially failed to increase the size of the stimulus while the rate cut was less than hoped for.""Equity markets took a notable shake out yesterday in response to the underwhelming actions of the ECB,"" said TrustNet Direct analyst Tony Cross.""The central bank´s stimulus measures fell some way short of expectations, initiating degree of panic across the board.""This rattled US markets after the European close last night and is once again taking a toll in early trade as the week´s final session gets underway.""The news sent the euro surging on Thursday to a one-month peak at $1.0981, having earlier hit a 7.5-month low of $1.0524 in highly volatile deals.""Draghi failed to deliver on investors´ expectations,"" said ETX Capital analyst Daniel Sugarman.""In November the ECB governor had stated that the ECB would ´do what we must to raise inflation as quickly as possible´ -- which investors took to mean the unveiling of a significant surge in monetary stimulus in December.""The single currency had come under fierce selling pressure leading up to the announcement as dealers positioned themselves for more far-reaching measures.- Fed caution -The euro´s gains were also given support after Federal Reserve boss Janet Yellen said the bank remained wary of a US interest rate rise because of concerns about a strong dollar and other central banks´ loose monetary policies.While the Fed is still widely expected to lift rates this month -- for the first time in nine years -- Yellen´s comments caused traders to baulk after a recent run-up in the dollar. Dealers are now awaiting the release of key US jobs data later in the day, although analysts say the report would need to be monstrously bad to prevent a Fed rate rise in December.Asian stocks finished in the red, with Tokyo down 2.2 percent, Shanghai shedding 1.7 percent and Sydney 1.5 percent lower.Oil prices rose Friday amid OPEC´s policy meeting in Vienna, where the cartel appears on course to maintain crude production levels despite a recent plunge to underneath $40 per barrel.- Key figures around 1130 GMT -London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.2 percent at 6,263 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 0.6 percent at 10,728Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 0.6 percent at 4,702 EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 0.4 percent at 3,149Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 2.2 percent at 19,504.48 (close)New York - Dow: DOWN 1.4 percent at 17,477.67 (close)Euro/dollar: DOWN to $1.0876 from $1.0947 in late US trade on ThursdayDollar/yen: UP to 122.80 yen from 122.61 yen

1471,Global stock selloff on seven year oil ,"London: Global oil prices tanked on Friday close to seven-year lows on oversupply woes, sparking a fresh wave of selling on European and US stock markets as panicked investors fled the energy sector. Crude, which has slumped since OPEC left its oil output at a record high level last week, took another tumble after the International Energy Agency (IEA) said oversupply would persist until late 2016. In response, Brent crude futures for January delivery collapsed to $38.90 per barrel -- a level last seen on December 31, 2008, during the global financial crisis. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in January dived to $36.12 -- last witnessed in February 2009. ""Comments from the IEA have ... seen both WTI and Brent fall aggressively, after they (indicated) that the unrelenting supply would see oil prices lower into the new year,"" said analyst James Hughes at trading firm GKFX. Traders were also positioning themselves before the weekend and next Wednesday´s expected interest rate hike, the first in nine years, from the US Federal Reserve. The prospect of higher rates boosts the greenback, which in turn makes dollar-priced crude more expensive for buyers using weaker currencies. That tends to weigh on oil demand and pull prices lower. ""Oil prices have fallen heavily again this morning as the commodity rout continues to dominate the week,"" Hughes told AFP. ""Prices have tumbled yet again as many investors try and position themselves ahead of the weekend, and also next week´s key Fed decision."" Oil has collapsed by more than 10 percent since the 13-nation Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries decided against cutting output despite plunging prices, weak global demand and the stubborn supply glut. That has sent shockwaves across world equity markets because low oil prices slash profits for energy majors like BP, Total and Royal Dutch Shell. In mid-afternoon trading, major European markets saw early losses deepen with the London FTSE 100 index shedding 1.8 percent to drop below the 6,000 mark, while Frankfurt and Paris lost 2.2 percent in value. BP´s share price slid 3.2 percent to 339.80 pence and Shell´s ´B´ shares dropped 4 percent to 1,498 pence and Anglo American shed 7 percent in a London session which saw just two FTSE 100 firms in positive territory. French giant Total saw its stock sink 3 percent. US stocks opened more than one percent lower, with investors selling down industrial heavyweights Dow Chemical and DuPont after they confirmed plans to merge. Ten minutes into trade, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was off 1.26 percent with the broad-based S&amp;P 500 and the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index similarly heading south. Dow Chemical and DuPont both gave up about half the sharp gains that came Wednesday on leaked news of their mega-merger, losing 3.9 percent and 5.8 percent respectively. Most Asian markets also sank at the end of a painful week for global equities defined by a commodities rout which analysts expect to continue. With the global economy struggling, China´s growth subdued and the dollar tipped to strengthen further, oil is expected to remain beaten down until possibly 2017. Shares in Hong Kong sank 1.1 percent -- a seventh-successive loss -- with CNOOC and PetroChina leading energy firms lower. On other markets Shanghai slipped 0.9 percent, but bargain-buying and a weaker yen helped Tokyo rally. - Key figures around 1500 GMT - London - FTSE 100: DOWN 1.8 percent at 5,979 pointsFrankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 2.2 percent at 10,362Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 2.2 percent at 4,531EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 2.0 percent at 3,206New York - Dow Jones: DOWN 1.3 percent at 17,353.27Tokyo - Nikkei 225: UP 1.0 percent at 19,230.48 (close)Euro/dollar: UP to $1.1021 from $1.0939 late in New York on Thursday.Dollar/yen: UP to 121.70 yen from 121.62 yen",2015-12-11

""We still have in mind the price of oil as well as the long-term ramifications of what the Federal Reserve is trying to do."" - Dow falters - In the US, the biggest losses came in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which shed 2.1 percent, with big companies including Apple, Boeing, JPMorgan Chase, Procter &amp; Gamble and Microsoft all losing between 2.7 percent and 4.1 percent. Another Dow company, Disney, fell 3.8 percent despite setting a record $57 million in opening-night ticket sales for its blockbuster ""Star Wars: The Force Awakens."" BTIG downgraded the stock, saying the strong performance of the movie will not be enough to offset weakness in Disney´s ESPN division. The Frankfurt and Paris exchanges closed down more than 1.0 percent while London ended the day off by 0.8 percent. Japan´s Nikkei 225 index dropped 1.9 percent following unexpected Bank of Japan policy tweaks that initially sent the yen briefly lower. In Argentina, the Merval index lost 4.5 percent following a week of shock economic reforms by the new conservative government, including a decision to scrap currency restrictions. The euro picked up to $1.0870 in foreign exchange deals having fallen heavily Wednesday after the US Federal Reserve raised borrowing costs from near zero, where they were pegged for seven years to support the recovery from the Great Recession. Next week´s economic calendar is relatively light ahead of the Christmas holiday Friday, when markets are closed. Investors will be keeping an eye on key data, including economic growth figures and existing-home sales, after the Fed rate move boosted hopes the world´s top economy was back on track. ""Investors are keen to confirm the health of the US housing market,"" Nomura Securities said in a commentary.  - Key figures at 2200 GMT -New York - Dow: DOWN 2.1 percent at 17,128.55 (close)New York - S&amp;P 500: DOWN 1.8 percent at 2,005.55 (close)New York - Nasdaq: DOWN 1.6 percent at 4,923.08 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 0.8 percent at 6,052.42 (close)Frankfurt - DAX 30: DOWN 1.2 percent at 10,608.19 (close)Paris - CAC 40: DOWN 1.1 percent at 4,625.26(close)EURO STOXX 50: DOWN 1.4 percent at 3,260.72 (close)Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 1.9 percent at 18,986.80 (close)Euro/dollar: UP to $1.0870 from $1.0824 late in New York ThursdayDollar/yen: DOWN to 121.26 yen from 122.60 yen",2015-12-19

1476,Oil ends 2015 down 35 per,"strong>NEW YORK/LONDON: Oil prices rose on Thursday but fell as much as 35 percent for the year after a race to pump by Middle East crude producers and U.S. shale oil drillers created an unprecedented global glut that may take through 2016 to clear.</strongGlobal oil benchmark Brent and U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures rose between 1 and 2 percent on the day on short-covering and buying support in a thinly traded market ahead of the New Year holiday.But for 2015, both benchmarks fell double-digits for a second straight year as Saudi Arabia and other members of the once-powerful Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) again failed to boost oil prices.The U.S. shale industry, meanwhile, surprised the world again with its ability to survive rock-bottom crude prices, churning out more supply than expected, even as the sell-off in oil slashed by two-thirds the number of drilling rigs in the country from a year ago.The United States also took a historic move in repealing a 40-year ban on U.S. crude exports to countries outside Canada, acknowledging the industry's growth.""You do have to tip your hat to the U.S. shale industry and their ongoing ability to drive down costs and hang in there, albeit by their fingernails,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital, an energy hedge fund in New York.Brent crude settled up 82 cents at $37.28 a barrel, rebounding from a near 11-year low of $36.10 hit earlier in the session. For the month, it was down 16 percent and for the year, it fell 35 percent. In 2014, Brent lost 48 percent.WTI rose 44 cents to $37.04 a barrel. It slid 11 percent in December and 30 percent for the year, after a 46 percent loss in 2014.The immediate outlook for oil prices remains bleak. Goldman Sachs has said prices as low as $20 per barrel might be necessary to push enough production out of business and allow a rebalancing of the market.Adding to oil's woes, floods across the Midwestern United States were threatening refineries and pipelines from Illinois to Louisiana, potentially swelling the glut of domestic crude at a time when stockpiles were already at record highs.A mild winter so far in the Northern Hemisphere due to the El Niño weather phenomenon has also slashed demand for heating oil. U.S. heating oil prices fell 40 percent for a second year in a row.""We have brimming oil inventories in Europe,"" Bjarne Schieldrop, chief commodity analyst at SEB in Oslo, said. ""And our predictions are that oil inventories in Asia are going to get closer to saturation in the first quarter.""Morgan Stanley said in its outlook for next year that ""headwinds (are) growing for 2016 oil.""The bank cited ongoing increases in available global supplies, despite some cuts by U.S. shale drillers. ""The hope for a rebalancing in 2016 continues to suffer serious setbacks,"" it said.strong>INDUSTRY PAIN</strongBrent prices briefly hit a 2004 bottom below $36 a barrel last week, effectively wiping out gains from a decade-long commodity super-cycle sparked by China's once-inexorable growth and energy demand boom.The downturn in oil has caused pain across the energy supply chain, including to shippers, private oil drillers and oil-dependent countries from Venezuela and Russia to the Middle East.Analysts estimate global crude production exceeds demand anywhere between half a million and 2 million barrels a day. This means even the most aggressive estimates of expected U.S. production cuts of 500,000 bpd for 2016 would be unlikely to fully rebalance the market.Oil began falling in mid-2014 as surging output from OPEC, Russia and U.S. shale producers outpaced demand. The downturn accelerated at the end of 2014 after a Saudi-led OPEC decision to keep production high to defend global market share rather than cut output to support prices.OPEC failed to agree on any production targets at its Dec. 4 meeting in Vienna, cementing its decision to protect market share, as the world braces for the return of Iranian crude exports to the market after the lifting of Western sanctions against Tehran.Russia is also showing no signs of reining in production, prompting traders, hedge fund managers and other speculators to establish record high active short positions in the market that would profit from further crude price falls.",2016-01-01

Holdings of the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares, rose 4.2 tonnes on Thursday, data from the fund showed.Bullion is often seen as an alternative investment during times of financial uncertainty, although safe-haven rallies tend to be short-lived.Gold slid 10 percent last year on fears higher U.S. rates would lower demand for the non-interest-paying asset, while boosting the dollar.

1478,Modi launches 15 bln fund to support start u,"NEW DELHI: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a number of initiatives on Saturday to support the country´s start-ups, including a 100 billion rupee ($1.5 billion) fund and a string of tax breaks for both the companies and their investors.India, which already has a handful of new generation success stories, is seeking to encourage more cutting edge technology and other start-ups - supporting new businesses in a country which badly needs to accelerate a still sluggish economic recovery and create millions of jobs as the workforce expands.Modi´s high-profile event in New Delhi - attended by hundreds of investors and entrepreneurs, including the founder of taxi-hailing app Uber, Travis Kalanick - promised a shot in the arm for the sector, with exemptions from tax and compliance inspections for three years.""I urge all entrepreneurs to create companies that solve India´s problems and create jobs,"" he told a packed auditorium in New Delhi, speaking in Hindi.""Start-up does not mean a billion dollar company where thousands of people work. It is about employing even 5 people, and developing India.""Online companies such as e-commerce marketplaces Flipkart and Snapdeal, along with ride-sharing company Ola, have highlighted the potential for home-grown technology successes in a country best known for capitalising on cheap engineering talent as the world´s back office.However, the push by Modi´s government is the first time Indian policymakers have announced an agenda directly aimed at promoting start-ups and entrepreneurship.Modi unveiled plans for a new 100 billion rupee fund: a structured fund of funds that will invest in venture capital funds over a period of four years, financed by the government and the state-owned Life Insurance Corporation (LIC).He also said start-up companies would benefit from cheaper and faster patent applications, enjoying 80 percent rebates on the cost of patents.A mobile app would allow companies to be set up within a day, he promised.Moreover, they will be exempt from income tax for the first three years in which they make a profit.Their investors could also benefit: recognised funds of funds could see exemptions<br/>from capital gains tax, Modi said.The announcements, at a government-organised conference on start-ups in New Delhi, come months after Modi made a whirlwind tour of Silicon Valley, meeting the chief executives of Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Apple Inc.India, with a rapidly expanding population of Internet users, is seen as one of the world´s fastest growing start-up hotspots.Venture capital funds including Sequoia and Tiger Global have raised multi-billion dollar funds for their Indian investments in recent years.The National Association of Software and Services Companies estimates the number of new companies launched in India grew by 40 percent in the last year.Earlier on Saturday, Japan´s Softbank said it would ""seriously"" accelerate investments in India, comparing the growth in India´s internet economy to China a decade ago.Softbank had previously said it would invest $10 billion in India over 10 years.WeWork, a New York-based provider of shared office space, used the conference to announce its Indian launch plans.",2016-01-16
1479,Asia stocks get welcome respite as crude prices bou,"strong>TOKYO: Battered crude oil prices bounced back from their lows on Thursday, propelling solid gains in Asian shares and the dollar.</strongThursday's gains built on Wall Street's consolidation overnight in which major indexes finished with declines of more than 1 percent, but well off the 3 percent plus they plumbed in the previous session when U.S. crude had dropped to 2003 lows.New front-month U.S. March oil futures fell nearly 4 percent on the day to close at $28.35 a barrel, but they were up 1.2 percent in Asian trade at $28.70, a far cry from the expiring contract on U.S. crude for February delivery, which slid 6.7 percent to settle at $26.55.Brent crude rose 1.4 percent to $28.27 in Asian trade.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan extended early gains and was up 1.4 percent while Japan's Nikkei average added 1.5 percent, clawing back some of the 3.7 percent it plunged in the previous session to a 14-1/2 month closing low.""Perhaps this stock market rebound comes from the usual suspects: Short-covering and bargain-hunting. However, today's results alone should not be seen as proof of an upward trend,"" said Hiroki Allen, chief representative of Superfund Securities Japan.China's bluechip CSI300 index was down 0.5 percent in early trade, and the Shanghai Composite Index slipped 0.8 percent.The dollar bounced back from a one-year low against its perceived safe-haven Japanese counterpart. The greenback added about 0.4 percent to 117.38 yen after falling as low as 115.97 on Wednesday, even as it marked impressive gains against some emerging market currencies.""It is not your ordinary day in the foreign exchange market when the Russian rouble and the Mexican peso hit record lows while the Hong Kong dollar falls to its weakest level since 1999,"" said Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York.""Emerging market countries bear the brunt of the selling because the slowdown in global growth and volatility in commodities causes significant economic damage for these countries,"" she said in a note to clients.U.S. data out on Wednesday undermined the dollar overnight. U.S. consumer prices unexpectedly fell in December, suggesting inflation was more sluggish than the U.S. Federal Reserve believed.Other Wednesday data showed a drop in housing starts and building permits last month, which led investors to pare expectations of further interest rate hikes this year.The euro edged down about 0.2 percent to $1.0870, ahead of the European Central Bank's regular policy meeting later in the session. Expectations are for the ECB to hold interest rates steady but highlight increasing risks to growth and inflation while keeping the door open for further easing steps later this year.",2016-01-21

It settled at $32.18 a barrel in the previous session.U.S. crude rose 5 cents to $32.24 a barrel, compared with its session-high of $32.64 and previous settlement at $32.19.""A change in investor sentiment was the key factor, with speculative short positions in WTI falling from historically high levels the previous week,"" ANZ said in a note on Monday, referring to U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude.""Low crude oil prices continue to negatively impact high cost U.S. oil producers. Indeed, recent Baker Hughes data suggested U.S. oil explorers idled more oil rigs this week.""Reuters market analyst for commodities and energy technicals Wang Tao said on Monday that Brent oil faces resistance at $32.72 per barrel, and may hover below this level for one day or retrace to support at $30.98, before rising again.A massive snowstorm on the U.S. East Coast helped stoke demand for oil for heating, helping push up crude prices. While New York and Philadelphia were getting back to business, Washington was not ready after an historic storm dumped more than 20 inches (51 cm) of snow on the city and nearly three feet (1 metre) in surrounding areas.Asian stocks gained early on Monday, relieved after seeing Wall Street rally on the back of a sharp rise in crude oil prices.

The U.S. government will release official stockpile data on Thursday.Options expiry in U.S. crude also fed Wednesday's rebound, some traders said.Some investors said they had a better outlook for oil now.""I'm pricing between $35 and $45 for Brent by summer, as we still have a daily surplus of up to 1.7 million barrels of oil to contend with,"" said Phil Davis, an independent crude trader at PSW Investments.Others were more skeptical. ""I think people will be in a wait-and-see mode,"" said Scott Shelton, energy broker for ICAP.

The country has been aspiring to reach middle-income status, and Rahman was seen as one of the driving forces helping Dhaka towards that goal.A former development economics professor, Rahman took over as the central bank governor in May 2009, and was nearing the end of his second term. One of his signature achievements has been shoring up the country's foreign exchange reserves, which have increased four-fold to $28 billion under his watch.He also tried to ensure farmers and women entrepreneurs had better access to banking services and credit.""He has set a good example by taking the responsibility for this incident,"" said Wahid Uddin Mahmud, a professor of economics at Dhaka University.   ",2016-03-15
1488,Oil steadies as US rig count drop offsets stockpile worry,"strong>NEW YORK: Oil prices steadied on Thursday, paring losses after a renewed drop in US oil rigs, but analysts and traders said there could be another selloff in the coming week if US crude stockpiles hit record highs again.</strongEarlier in the day, US crude futures slid 4 percent and Brent below $40 a barrel, extending bearish sentiment from Wednesday when the US government reported a crude inventory build three times above market expectations.But data later on Thursday from oil services firm Baker Hughes, showing US oil drillers cutting 15 rigs this week after a pause last week, boosted sentiment. The US oil rig count now stands at 372, the lowest since November 2009.US crude's front-month contract CLc1 settled down 33 cents at $39.46 a barrel, recovering from a session low of $38.33. For the week, it rose two cents, finishing up for a sixth straight week.Brent's front-month LCOc1 settled down 3 cents on the day at $40.44 a barrel, after an earlier drop to $39.22. For the week, it fell 76 cents, or nearly 2 percent, its first decline in six weeks.Despite the stumble, oil prices remain about 50 percent higher from multi-year lows hit in January from glut worries. While declining US oil output and strong gasoline demand were responsible for some of that recovery, the bulk of it was powered by major producers' plans to freeze output at January's highs.While this week's drop of oil 15 rigs was not a game changer to the market, it offered a reprieve to worries that there was a daily glut of some two million barrels in crude.""After last week's increase of one rig, some may have assumed that the continuing decrease in rig counts was finally abating,"" said Pete Donovan, broker at Liquidity Futures in New York. ""Apparently not so.""Others braced for further price weakness from more US inventory builds.""We see limited bullish assistance to the complex from a fundamental vantage point,"" said Jim Ritterbusch of Chicago-based oil consultancy Ritterbusch &amp; Associates.Shares on Wall Street, trading in tandem with crude most of this year, also clawed back from the lows of the day, helping oil recover.The dollar meanwhile, erased early gains that made oil and other commodities denominated in the greenback less affordable to holders of the euro and other currencies.Volumes in oil were thin ahead of the Good Friday and Easter break, making it easier to retrace losses after sentiment swung.",2016-03-25

June Brent closed 0.7 percent higher at $40.33.The benchmark's front-month soared 10 percent higher in March - its best month since April 2015 - and jumped 6 percent in the first quarter - its best quarter since the second quarter in 2015.U.S. crude futures settled at $38.34, up 2 cents on the day, rising 14 percent in March and 4 percent in the quarter - also its biggest quarterly gain since June 2015.In a Reuters poll, oil analysts raised their average price forecasts for 2016 for the first time in 10 months - Brent averaging $40.90 and U.S. crude $39.70 in 2016 - but cautioned the rally could fade near term.On Thursday, the dollar hit a mid-October low, making greenback-denominated oil more attractive to holders of the euro and other currencies.Data from market intelligence firm Genscape showed a 807,496-barrel drawdown in stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma delivery hub for U.S. crude futures in the week to March 29, traders said.Inventories at Cushing have receded from record highs for two consecutive weeks, with U.S. government data on Wednesday showing a 272,000-barrel drawdown in the week ending March 25.Total U.S. crude stocks, however, rose 2.3 million barrels last week to 534.8 million barrels, a record high for a seventh straight week.OPEC crude output rose in March to 32.47 million barrels per day from 32.37 million bpd in February, a Reuters survey said.Analysts also expect an April 17 meeting of major oil producers in Doha to discuss the output freeze to fall short of expectations.""There is a clear risk of disappointment and for a temporary setback in prices ahead or immediately after the Doha meeting,"" Carsten Fritsch, commodities analyst at Commerzbank, told the Reuters Global Oil Forum.",2016-04-01

U.S. crude futures CLc1 closed up $2.46, or 6.6 percent, to $39.72, up nearly 8 percent for the week.The Europe Oil and Gas index was up more than 3 percent while the S&amp;P energy index climbed 2 percent as the top-performing sectors in each region, tracking the rise in crude prices.""Clearly if you are looking at it from an index perspective, the stronger commodities are having a bit of a positive effect,"" said Nick Kalivas, senior equity strategist at Invesco PowerShares in Chicago.""The market still remains very focussed on energy as kind of an indicator of economic health and credit risk that I dont think has faded yet.""The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35 points, or 0.2 percent, to 17,576.96, the S&amp;P 500 gained 5.68 points, or 0.28 percent, to 2,047.59 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.32 points, or 0.05 percent, to 4,850.69.Even with Friday's modest gains, the S&amp;P 500 suffered its biggest weekly decline in two months.MSCI's index of world shares rose 0.68 percent but was down 0.55 percent for the week. The FTSEurofirst 300 closed up 1.2 percent, but still notched a fourth straight weekly decline, its longest losing streak since October 2014.Much of the volatility this week has been fuelled by the yen's surge against the dollar, which caught many market participants off-guard and increased speculation Tokyo could intervene in the currency market to halt the rally.The dollar briefly traded above 109.00 yen, recovering from its first break below 108.00 since October 2014 on Thursday. Japanese Finance Minister Taro Aso said the government would take steps to counter ""one-sided"" moves in the yen in either direction.However, those gains faded late in the session and the dollar was last off 0.04 percent at 108.16 yen, for a weekly fall of 3.1 percent.Sharp appreciation of the safe-haven yen against the dollar is often a warning sign of broader financial market stress and investor risk aversion, which has been exacerbated this week by growing uncertainty surrounding the U.S. economic and policy outlook.Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a conversation with former Fed chairmen on Thursday, said the U.S. economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes.New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday said the central bank must approach further rate hikes cautiously and gradually because of lingering external risks to the U.S. economy, despite some strength at home and welcome hints of inflation.The comments helped push benchmark 10-year Treasuries down 9/32 in price to yield 1.784 percent after they hit a low six-week of 1.685 percent on Thursday.",2016-04-09

It later pared some gains to trade up 0.8 percent at $1,249.70 an ounce by 0202 GMT, following its best weekly gain in five weeks last week.""Markets are still jittery about what's going on in the global economy... and gold is the preferred safe-haven,"" said OCBC Bank analyst Barnabas Gan.Gold will remain elevated in the short term, Gan said, but he expected the metal to give back some of its gains later in the year as the Federal Reserve carried out two rate hikes.Higher rates would weigh on gold by lifting the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.Waning expectations for further rate increases this year helped gold to its best quarter in nearly 30 years in the three months to March.Fed Chair Janet Yellen on Thursday said the U.S. economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes. The U.S. central bank raised rates in December for the first time in nearly a decade.New York Fed President William Dudley on Friday said the central bank must approach further rate hikes cautiously and gradually because of lingering external risks to the U.S. economy, despite some strength at home and welcome hints of inflation.The dollar slid 0.15 percent against a basket of major currencies, falling close to last week's low of 94.015, also the lowest since mid-October.MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan eased 0.4 percent, while Japan's Nikkei stock index fell nearly 2 percent.Data on Friday showed hedge funds and money managers cut their net long positions in gold futures and options in the week to April 5, but still not far from a two-month high.Assets in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.22 percent to 817.81 tonnes on Friday.",2016-04-11

1494,IMF cuts global growth outlook agai,"strong>WASHINGTON: The International Monetary Fund warned on Tuesday of the risk of political isolationism, notably Britain's possible exit from the European Union, and the risk of growing economic inequality as it cut its global economic growth forecast for the fourth time in a year.</strongIn the run-up to the annual spring meetings of the IMF and the World Bank in Washington, D.C. this week, the IMF said the global economy was vulnerable to shocks such as sharp currency devaluations and worsening geopolitical conflicts.In its latest World Economic Outlook, the IMF forecast global economic growth of 3.2 percent this year, compared to a forecast of 3.4 percent in January. The growth estimate also was lowered in July and October of last year.For 2017, the IMF said the global economy would grow 3.5 percent, down 0.1 percentage point from its January estimate.Its latest report cited a worsening spillover from China's economic slowdown as well as the impact of low oil prices on emerging markets such as Brazil. It also highlighted persistent economic weakness in Japan, Europe and the United States.The gloomier picture sets the stage for the IMF and the World Bank to call this week for more coordinated global action to support growth.""In brief, lower growth means less room for error,"" IMF's chief economist, Maurice Obstfeld, told a news conference, adding that ""scarring effects"" from years of tepid growth could in turn weaken demand, thin the workforce, and reduce potential output further, creating a scenario of ""secular stagnation.""strong>ISOLATIONISM GROWS</strongIn its report, the IMF warned that the rise of nationalist parties in Europe, the June 23 ""Brexit"" referendum, and anti-trade rhetoric in the U.S. presidential campaign posed threats to the global economic outlook.A British exit from the EU could do ""severe regional and global damage by disrupting established trading relationships,"" it said.""We're definitely facing the risk of going into doldrums that could be politically perilous,"" said Obstfeld, who pointed to stagnant wage growth as fueling a growing sense of economic inequality that is spilling into the voting booth in many countries.The IMF urged policymakers to boost growth with actions such as deregulating certain industries and raising labor market participation. It recommended nations with fiscal breathing room boost investments in infrastructure and cut labor taxes, and it encouraged central banks to keep monetary policy accommodative.The IMF's report and the gathering of officials and central bankers in Washington this week comes against the backdrop of widening rows in Europe over negative interest rates, a refugee crisis, and how to shore up Greece's financial bailout program.German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday that the European Central Bank's record low interest rates were causing ""extraordinary problems"" for German banks and pensioners, and risked undermining voters' support for European integration.Official negotiations over Greece's bailout review have been idled during the IMF and World Bank meetings, but the debate over whether to provide more debt relief to Athens in exchange for further budget cuts is expected to continue on the sidelines.Obstfeld repeated the IMF's demand for a bailout program that would put Greece on a path to sustain its debt and begin growing again, adding that there should be some flexibility to help its government deal with the massive numbers of refugees who have fled to Greece from war-torn countries.strong>FORECASTS FOR JAPAN, U.S. ALSO CUT</strongThe IMF on Tuesday cut Japan's growth forecast for 2016 in half to 0.5 percent. It said Brazil's economy would now shrink by 3.8 percent this year versus the previous forecast of a 3.5 percent contraction, as Latin America's largest economy struggles through its deepest recession in decades.Meanwhile, the United States, one of the relative bright spots in the global economy, also saw its 2016 growth forecast cut to 2.4 percent from 2.6 percent. The IMF said it anticipated an increased drag on U.S. exports from a stronger U.S. dollar, while low oil prices would keep energy investment weak.U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew will urge G20 and IMF members to take steps to bolster demand, but also to ""avoid persistent exchange rate misalignments and refrain from targeting exchange rates for competitive purposes,"" a senior Treasury official told reporters.The IMF nudged China's growth forecast slightly higher to 6.5 percent this year, and 6.2 percent in 2017, partly due to previously announced policy stimulus moves. However, the Fund added that it was reducing its longer-term growth forecasts for China and said the Asian nation's ""momentous"" shift away from investment-led growth was continuing to chill global trade.",2016-04-13
1495,US government worse than all major industries on cyber security repor,"strong>WASHINGTON: US federal, state and local government agencies rank in last place in cyber security when compared against 17 major private industries, including transportation, retail and healthcare, according to a new report released Thursday.</strongThe analysis, from venture-backed security risk benchmarking startup SecurityScorecard, measured the relative security health of government and industries across 10 categories, including vulnerability to malware infections, exposure rates of passwords and susceptibility to social engineering, such as an employee using corporate account information on a public social network.Educations, telecommunications and pharmaceutical industries also ranked low, the report found.Information services, construction, food and technology were among the top performers.Government agencies have struggled for years to keep pace with malicious hackers and insider threats, a challenge that came into focus after it was disclosed last year that more than 21 million individuals had their sensitive data pilfered during a breach at the Office of Personnel Management.SecurityScorecard said it tracked 35 major data breaches across government from April 2015 to April 2016.President Barack Obama has made improving cyber defenses a top priority of his remaining year in office.His administration asked Congress to dedicate $19 billion to cyber security in its fiscal 2017 budget proposal, which would include $3.1 billion for technology modernization at various federal agencies.Federal agencies scored most poorly on network security, software patching flaws and malware, according to SecurityScorecard, which said they may be more vulnerable to risk due to their large size.Of the 600 government entities tracked, NASA performed the worst, the report found.The space exploration agency was vulnerable to email spoofing and malware intrusions, among other weaknesses, according to SecurityScorecard´s analysis.Other low-performing government organizations included the US Department of State and the information technology systems used by Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington and Maricopa County, Arizona.Government organizations with the strongest security postures included Clark County, Nevada, the US Bureau of Reclamation, and the Hennepin County Library in Minnesota.",2016-04-14
1496,Oil prices tumble 5 percent after producers fail to coordinate outpu,"strong>SINGAPORE/LONDON: Oil prices tumbled 5 percent early on Monday after a meeting by major producers in Qatar fell apart the day before, leaving the world awash with unwanted fuel.</strongInternational benchmark Brent crude futures were trading at $40.86 per barrel at 0029 GMT, down 5.2 percent since their last settlement.US crude futures were down 5.7 percent at $38.06 a barrel.Some 18 oil exporting nations, including non-OPEC Russia, had gathered in the Qatari capital of Doha for what was expected to be the rubber-stamping of a deal to stabilise output at January levels until October 2016.But the deal fell apart after Saudi Arabia demanded that Iran join in despite calls on Riyadh to save the agreement and help prop up crude prices.""The failure is negative from the psychological point of view. It shows the inability of all sides to cooperate,"" said Gary Ross, the founder and executive chairman at New York-based consultancy PIRA.The development will revive industry fears that major producers are embarking again on a battle for market share in a world already awash with unwanted oil, especially after Riyadh threatened to raise output steeply if no freeze deal were reached.As a result Brent would likely average $36 per barrel during the second quarter of this year as a global glut continued unabated, it said.""This meeting and its outcome should have built confidence that the oil market rebalancing was close at hand, as well as building a circle of trust among producers for possible future cooperation and coordinated action. In this regard, the meeting was a complete failure,"" Barclays added.""The failure of the talks gives the market another clear indication (similar to the failed December 2015 OPEC meeting) that OPEC's relevance in this market environment has faded, and its ability to coordinate with members outside the group is equally difficult.""Oil prices have fallen by as much as 70 percent since mid-2014 as producers have pumped 1 to 2 million barrels of crude every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold fuel.Beyond the failed deal, however, there were signs of a tightening market due to an oil worker strike in Kuwait which may have cut its production from 2.85 million barrels per day (bpd) to just 1.1 million bpd.In the United States, oil services company Baker Hughes Inc said on Friday that drillers had cut their rigs to fresh 2009 lows as the industry suffers from low prices.",2016-04-18
1497,Asian shares rise on tentative bounce in crude oi,"strong>TOKYO: Asian share markets rose on Tuesday, taking their cue from gains on Wall Street after a strike in Kuwait helped spark a recovery in crude oil prices.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan was up 0.5 percent.Japan's Nikkei stock index was up 3.4 percent in early trading, a day after it plunged by that same percentage as investors assessed the impact of earthquakes in southwestern Japan's Kyushu on manufacturers' supply chains.Brazil's Bovespa index fell 0.6 percent overnight as President Dilma Rousseff vowed to fight her impeachment, which could force her from office after 13 years of leftist Workers' Party rule.Beleaguered crude oil futures found a bottom after plunging as talks broke down in Doha over the weekend, where producers had hoped to curb a supply glut. A strike in Kuwait temporarily slashed the country's oil output by more than half, and helped pull crude prices off their lows.Brent crude was up about 0.1 percent at $42.97 a barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.5 percent to $39.96.""Oil started the day sharply lower after key producers failed to reach an agreement to freeze production but the losses were short lived as reports of a strike in Kuwait sparked a U-turn that briefly took prices into positive territory,"" Kathy Lien, managing director at BK Asset Management in New York, said in a note to clients.That helped commodity-linked currencies come roaring back to life after steep losses following the Doha deal breakdown.The Australian dollar was last up 0.4 percent at $0.7775 after earlier rising as high as $0.7778, its highest since June. On Monday, it had skidded as low as $0.7594.The perceived safe-haven yen slumped in line with the recovery in risk appetite. The dollar added 0.3 percent to 109.12 yen, while the euro added 0.3 percent to 123.35 yen, moving away from the previous session's three-year low.Against the dollar, the euro edged down about 0.1 percent to $1.1306, as investors looked ahead to the European Central Bank's policy meeting on Thursday. While no change is expected, investors are awaiting Mario Draghi's news conference for clues on the central bank's thinking.The U.S. Federal Reserve will meet next week, and is also expected to hold pat on policy, though any suggestion that more hikes are on the way sooner rather than later would lift the greenback.New York Fed President William Dudley said in a speech on Monday that economic conditions are ""mostly favorable"" yet the central bank remains cautious in raising interest rates because threats loom.For the second time in as many weeks, Boston Fed President Eric Rosengren warned on Monday that futures markets, which see only one modest rate hike in each of the next few years, are off the mark.",2016-04-19

The company intends to appeal the jury´s decision and will continue defending its products´ safety, she said.Ristesund said she used J&amp;J´s talc-based powder products  which include the well-known Baby Powder and Shower to Shower Powder  on her genitals for decades. According to her lawyers, she was diagnosed with ovarian cancer and had to undergo a hysterectomy and related surgeries.The verdict follows a $72 million jury award from the same court in February to the family of a woman who died from ovarian cancer after years of using talc powder for feminine hygiene.Plaintiffs in talc litigation, which is concentrated in Missouri and New Jersey state courts, have accused J&amp;J of failing for years to warn that talc was linked to an increased risk for ovarian cancer.J&amp;J has said that it acted properly in developing and marketing the products.",2016-05-03
1499,Gold slips as dollar holds firm after US jobs d,"strong>MELBOURNE: Spot gold edged lower on Monday, but remained supported in the face of a firm dollar as investors bet a weaker US payroll report would push out the timing of any rate hike.</strongThe US economy added the fewest number of jobs in seven months in April and Americans dropped out of the labour force, leaving some economists anticipating only one interest rate hike this year. But encouraging annual wage growth data helped the dollar to revive.""Gold held on to a lot of the gains despite the strengthening dollar - it seems to be well supported,"" said analyst Daniel Hynes at ANZ in Sydney.""Investors certainly saw the payroll numbers being a positive in terms of no rate hike in the shorter term, which lessened the blow of that stronger currency,"" he added.Spot gold eased 0.2 percent to $1,286.11 an ounce by 0145 GMT, after hitting a five-month high last week, and is consolidating within a $1,268-$1,303 trading band. Spot gold closed little changed last week after a 5 percent jump the week before.US gold slipped half a percent to $1,288.20.Helping the dollar rebound, New York Federal Reserve President William Dudley said two U.S. rate hikes this year were still a ""reasonable expectation.""A stronger dollar erodes the purchasing power of buyers paying with other currencies.""We still expect the price of gold to rise further, underpinned by demand for inflation hedges as inflationary pressures continue to build,"" said Capital Economics in a research note.Elsewhere, a run of Chinese data this week is expected to show activity moderated in April after a strong showing in March. A Reuters poll forecast a small drop in all-important exports last month.Hedge funds and money managers raised their net long positions in COMEX gold and copper contracts in the week to May 3, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission data showed on Friday.China's gold reserves stood at 58.14 million fine troy ounces at the end of April, up from 57.79 million fine troy ounces at the end of March, the central bank said.",2016-05-09
1500,dollar dominance global currency,"strong>LONDON: The world is getting an object lesson on the problems of having one dominant global currency and even the supposed prime beneficiary, the United States, can see the downside.</strongAlarming bouts of volatility in world financial markets over the past 12 months have been rooted in a fear of what happens when a world with its highest-ever peacetime debt pile faces even a hint of higher interest rates.Despite a constant narrative about U.S. households and banks paying down debts ever since the global credit crash eight years ago, any 'deleveraging' that did happen was more than offset by higher government, corporate and personal debt around the globe in Europe, China and across emerging markets.In fact, aggregate world debt is now far higher than it was before the 2007-08 crash.""The saga of debt is far from over,"" says a report from Morgan Stanley. It goes on to explain why Morgan Stanley expects demographic-led shifts in savings and investment to soon push interest rates higher and transform that debt mountain into additional deadweight on world growth over next five years.But the role of the U.S. dollar as the world's main reserve currency denominating large chunks of that debt pile is showing up as complicating factor that's added to risk of instability.The first U.S. interest rate increase in almost a decade in December - just a quarter of a percentage point - was enough to trigger a convulsion in world markets that led to the worst start to a year for global stocks since World War Two.Underlining 'cause and effect', the subsequent recovery only came about once the Federal Reserve hastily made clear it was pressing the pause button precisely because of seismic events in world finance.Few doubt a growing U.S. economy that's near full employment can absorb some normalization of interest rates from near zero, and a higher dollar goes hand in hand with that.But the rest of the world clearly can't.The Bank for International Settlements estimates that while U.S. dollar dominance means it accounts for almost 90 percent of all foreign exchange transactions and some 60 percent of hard currency reserves. But crucially it also accounts for about 60 percent of all debts and assets outside the United States.And if the rest of the world goes into shock because of the higher cost of servicing and paying back those dollar debts, the boomerang effect on U.S. exporters, commodity firms and the wider economy just ends up tying the Fed's hands in ways made crystal clear this year already.strong>AMBIVALENCE</strongNo surprise, then, the U.S. central bank has no deep love for the dollar's prime reserve currency status - even though it's been described by Europeans and others over the years as an ""exorbitant privilege"" that ensures the world lends to the U.S. Treasury in its own currency at low interest rates regardless of dollar strength.Speaking at an event in Zurich on Tuesday on the dollar's global status, New York Fed chief Bill Dudley said Americans should not be perturbed if other currencies such as the euro or China's yuan eventually eat into the dollar's share of reserves.""If other countries' currencies emerge to gain stature as reserve currencies, it is not obvious to me that the United States loses,"" he said, as long as it ""is being driven by their progress, rather than by the U.S. doing a poorer job.""While that's far from wishing away dollar hegemony, it speaks to the greater ambivalence among central bankers toward reserve status than their national treasury chiefs - given how widespread use of the currency can compromise domestic policy.It's that tension that risks sowing instability everywhere.If the Fed can't adjust monetary policy because of fears of transmitting a self-defeating shockwave around the world via the dollar, then there's understandable concern that artificially low Fed policy just stores up even more debt and international accounting imbalances and undermines the very currency that's supposed to play anchor.At the same event in Zurich, Claudio Borio, head of the monetary and economic Department of the BIS, said the dollar's role could potentially exacerbate instability by allowing the United States to run larger and more persistent fiscal and current account deficits - and to run looser monetary policy for longer.What's more, a resulting Fed easing bias spreads to developed and emerging economies as governments resist a weaker dollar for competitiveness or financial stability reasons, Borio added.""Easing begets easing,"" he said.For Morgan Stanley, this is just leads to ever-higher debt, and there are no painless ways out of a problem that will start to hurt significantly over the coming years - only a series of ""less painful"" options including the option of consolidating debts and making them permanent or perpetual.In the meantime, the U.S. bank said, the dollar itself will most likely push higher again, if only because the U.S. economy is probably the only one that can absorb a rising exchange rate in this environment.For Borio, a more 'pluralistic' system with many world currencies sharing the reserve role doesn't by itself solve any problem, either. There would then be no credible single anchor.Hard-headed cooperation and joint decision making may be the only answer.""This means not just putting one's house in order, but also putting our global village in order.""",2016-05-11
1501,Oil jumps on outag,"strong>NEW YORK: Brent jumped 4 percent on Tuesday while US crude settled up more than 2 percent, after a late burst of buying driven in part by expectations that record US crude inventories would not swell by as much as they have in recent weeks.</strongCrude supply outages in Canada, Nigeria and elsewhere also boosted prices. Brent's gain was its biggest one-day percentage move in a month.The market pared gains briefly in post-settlement trade after the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry group, said U.S. crude inventories rose by 3.45 million barrels to record highs of 543.1 million during the week ended May 6.Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a build of only 714,000-barrels.Traders and investors will be looking out for official inventory data on Wednesday from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""We should roll back a good part of today's gains if the EIA confirms the builds cited by API or comes up with even larger numbers,"" said Tariq Zahir, crude trader and managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.Brent LCOc1 settled up $1.89, or 4.3 percent, at $45.52 per barrel. More than 6,000 contracts changed hands in the final minute, Reuters data showed. The global oil benchmark rose to as high as $45.70 in post-settlement trading. After settlement, it briefly dipped more than 30 cents on the API data, then recovered to near its settlement price.U.S. crude's West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures CLc1 rose 1.22, or 2.8 percent, to settle at $44.66. WTI also fell briefly on the API data.Refined oil products joined the rally, with gasoline RBc1 closing up 3 percent and ultralow sulphur diesel HOc1, or heating oil, 4 percent.Oil prices were up most of the day on worries about supply outages.Wildfires in Canada have shut in more than 1 million barrels per day of production from Alberta's oil sands region. Royal Dutch Shell Plc was the first to resume production in the area on Tuesday while others looked to restart after more than a week of halted operations.In Nigeria, attacks on oil infrastructure have pushed crude output close to a 22-year low in Africa's largest oil producer, Reuters data showed.This year's rebound in oil has been one of the strongest since the financial crisis. Prices have rallied nearly 80 percent from multiyear lows under $30 in the first quarter, supported by falling U.S. production, supply constraints in Libya and the Americas and a weak dollar.Since the end of April, the rally has stalled at around $45.",2016-05-11
1502,Oil prices fall as Canadian oil sands fields gradually retur,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell early on Thursday, weighed by the gradual return of Canadian oil sands production, reversing a sharp rise the previous day when the U.S. government detailed an unexpected fall in crude inventories.</strongInternational Brent crude futures were trading at $47.13 per barrel at 0143 GMT on Thursday, down 47 cents, or 1 percent, from their last settlement. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures CLc1 were down 38 cents or 0.8 percent at $45.85.Traders said the dips were largely a result of profit taking following intra-day Brent price rises of up to $2.95 the previous day.""A lot of people think that yesterday's jump was a bit over the top, so they've taken the profit while they could this morning,"" said one oil trader.The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Wednesday that U.S. crude inventories fell 3.4 million barrels to 540 million barrels last week, compared with analysts' expectations for an increase of 714,000 barrels and the American Petroleum Institute's (API) reported build of 3.5 million barrels in preliminary data issued on Tuesday.The surprise draw in crude inventories was offset on Thursday by an expected increase in Canadian oil sand crude production following disruptions to over 1 million barrels of daily production capacity due to wildfire.""We were not totally surprised with the draw after the shut-in in Canadian production,"" said Tariq Zahir, managing partner at Tyche Capital Advisors in New York.",2016-05-12
1503,Comic books teach fi,"strong>NEW YORK: It's a bird, it's a plane, and its a ... financial planner? The next time your kid brings home a comic book, it might not be just about battles, explosions and good versus evil. Instead, it might be about evaluating wants versus needs, living within your means and creating emergency funds.</strongThat is because financial services company Visa Inc has partnered with Marvel Comics to create ""Rocket's Powerful Plan,"" a new comic book starring the superhero team Guardians of the Galaxy. The comic is slated to be sent to every public library in the United States, and there are more than 150,000 copies printed in eight languages.The theme: why it makes sense to cultivate money smarts.""The challenge was to create a fun, action-packed story while also including a lesson on personal finance,"" said Darren Sanchez, an editor at Marvel. ""Trying to squeeze educational information into a story can be tough, especially with a topic like money management. To make it work you have to be careful not to overwhelm the story.""After all, as any parent knows, children listen to very little of what you have to say, especially when it comes to money. When it is the Guardians of the Galaxy who are talking (Rocket, Groot, Star-Lord, Gamora, and Drax the Destroyer), they are more likely to actually pay attention.So who is the Suze Orman of the superhero world, dispensing personal finance advice while defeating powerful foes at the same time? Turns out it is Rocket, an intelligent raccoon, who is voiced by Bradley Cooper in the recent big-screen film.When the squad receives a fee for exterminating robopests, Rocket suggests putting some of that money aside for an emergency fund. That cash later comes in handy when the group has to repair their spaceship, and purchase high-tech weapons to vanquish their enemies. (Sorry about the spoilers.)The comic is the second such venture by Visa. The original, produced in 2012, featured the Avengers and Spider-Man tossing off money advice. It proved to be so popular with educators that more than half a million copies were eventually printed.This time, in addition to the Guardians of the Galaxy, look for cameos by Ant-Man, Iron Man, Thor, Black Widow and Hulk. It was produced in languages including English, Spanish, Mandarin, Japanese and Malay.""We wanted simple messages that kids could latch on to and take out of it, like saving for a rainy day,"" said Hugh Norton, Visa's head of financial education. ""Issues like emergency savings are extremely important, and something we can drill into kids from an early age.""On the back of the comic book, kids will find interactive games like word searches, where they can try to locate terms like ""budget,"" ""currency"" and ""goal,"" for example.There is also a wants-versus-needs challenge. Should you spend money on necessities like ""water"" and ""a place to live,"" or luxuries like ""video games"" and ""candy""? (On second thought, kids, do not answer that.)Judging from a recent survey, it seems like parents could indeed use all the help they can get in explaining money topics to kids.ALMOST AS 'BAD' AS DEATH AND SEXIn the annual ""Parents, Kids &amp; Money"" survey by Baltimore-based money managers T. Rowe Price Group Inc, more than half of parents admitted they were ""somewhat,"" ""very"" or ""extremely"" reluctant to talk about financial issues with their children. The only subjects they were more reluctant to talk about? Death and sex.And 44 percent have not talked to their kids at all about financial subjects including long-term investing, market volatility, or financial statements.That is where a money-oriented comic book like ""Rocket's Powerful Plan"" could come in handy. In the past Visa has tried out other innovative avenues to reach out to kids, as well, such as sponsoring financial literacy-themed National Football League games.Marvel has put its deep bench of superheroes to work on other custom projects, as well, including for Netflix Inc, Walt Disney Co's Disney Interactive, ESPN and the Make-A-Wish Foundation.Even superheroes are not immune from the financial challenges of parenthood, by the way. In Visa and Marvel's new comic, when Ant-Man gets a cut of the fee from the Guardians of the Galaxy for helping eliminate their enemies, what does that cash go toward?Purchasing a drum set for his daughter.",2016-05-13

In the April 14 letter Thomas Baxter, general counsel and executive vice president at the New York Fed, said the correct procedures were followed in approving five transfers of money on<br/>Feb.4 and in blocking 30.Baxter said the New York Fed´s procedures for checking transfers included catching those to people subject to sanctions<br/>but would not stop a transfer if it had passed the authentication process on the SWIFT messaging network.""The vast majority of authenticated instructions received from foreign official account holders are not flagged for manual review by the automated systems,"" Baxter wrote in the letter.Authorities in Bangladesh and elsewhere are still trying to figure out how hackers carried out the attack and what happened to the money, which was routed from the Bangladesh Bank´s account at the New York Fed to accounts in the Philippines.Maloney said in a statement on Friday that while Baxter´s letter provided key information about the incident, she remained<br/>""concerned that there are critical security gaps in the international payment system.""Maloney said she would urge the New York Fed to review its security protocols to make sure such a heist does not recur.",2016-05-14

Spot prices are down 1.5 percent this week and facing a third straight week of losses.""From the point of view that the dollar has strengthened it makes sense that precious metals pare back some of the recent gains,"" Saxo Bank analyst Ole Hansen said.""We, however, managed to find support at $1,245, a key reversal level on gold. Negative yields and the prospect of higher inflation will continue to provide support.""New York Fed President William Dudley said on Thursday that there was a strong sense among central bank officials that markets were underestimating the probability of policy tightening.That came a day after the minutes of the Fed's April meeting revealed that most policymakers felt a rate increase might be appropriate as early as next month.Gold is highly sensitive to rising rates, which lift the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion.

1507,IMF researchers say Japan monetary easing has benefits for Asian economi,"WASHINGTON: Japan´s extraordinarily easy monetary policy, a source of friction with the United States for pushing the yen´s value down, has had some positive effects on emerging Asian economies, including increased growth and equity prices, International Monetary Fund researchers have found.The IMF findings were released in a paper on Friday, as Group of Seven finance ministers and central bank governors began meeting in Japan, where divergent views on Japan´s monetary policy and currency market interventions were expected to be a hot topic.The paper claims to be the first to model the spillover effects of Japan´s qualitative and quantitative easing program (QQE) on Southeast Asian countries.QQE was launched in 2013 and targets both government bond purchases as well as other assets, such as exchange-traded funds and real estate investment trusts.The program has helped push down the yen from 82 to the dollar in 2012 to 119 to the dollar by August 2015. Japanese equity prices surged and inflation also strengthened during this period.Despite Southeast Asian currencies rising against the yen, they mirrored some of these effects, study authors GiovanniGanelli, and Nour Tawk said. ""Our results show that implementation of QQE in Japan, when estimated by a positive shock to Japanese equity prices, consistently caused an increase in equity prices across emerging Asian countries, as well as an appreciation of their currencies,"" they wrote.""Most (Southeast Asian) countries experienced an increase in output and a temporary increase in inflation. Capital inflows surged in many countries.""They argue that while most existing research uses interest rate changes as proxies for quantitative easing, this transmission channel is broken in Japan because rates have been at the zero bound for an extended period.Instead, they use stock market surges and increases in the monetary base as proxies for QQE.The researchers said that Japan´s QQE caused a significant increase in equity prices in emerging Asia, with increases in the 2 to 5 percent range for China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Indonesia.And while nearly all countries surveyed experienced an appreciation of their currencies versus the yen as a result of QQE, it had a ""generally positive"" impact on growth in emerging Asian countries, with statistically significant increases in<br/> Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand.",2016-05-21

It reached $49.24 in after-hours trade.U.S. equities surged, giving oil a further lift, as investors grew more comfortable with the possibility that the U.S. Federal Reserve might soon raise interest rates. Crude buyers also seemed unfazed by a stronger dollar, which typically makes greenback-denominated oil costlier in other currencies.Earlier in the session, oil was supported by the drop in Iraqi oil output to 4.5 million barrels per day from January's record high of 4.78 million bpd.Consultant IHS said just 2.8 billion barrels of oil were discovered outside North America in 2015 following a sharp fall in exploration and appraisal drilling. It was the lowest total since 1952.

An early start to negotiations on the Agreement on Automatic Exchange of Information would be important in this respect,"" he said, referring to a portal supported by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).Modi promised in his 2014 election campaign to recover billions of dollars sent to tax havens abroad to avoid income tax, now about 30 percent in India.Schneider-Ammann said no figure had been put on the amount of ""black money"" to be recovered. Talks would begin later this month, he said.Modi said Switzerland had also agreed to support its bid for membership of the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), which it applied to join last month, having won a waiver in 2008 that accorded it the right to trade in commercial nuclear technology.New Delhi's bid for full membership of the 48-nation club, if granted, would tip the balance of power in South Asia against its arch-rival Pakistan, whose own application has been backed by China despite questions over its proliferation record.Modi tacked on Switzerland and Mexico as extra stops on a five-country tour to seek their support on joining the NSG. He left Switzerland for Washington, where U.S. President Barack Obama is expected to offer his backing also.Both Switzerland and Mexico have been viewed as sceptical about India's bid for nuclear legitimacy. They are among countries concerned that India has not signed the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, a step that would require New Delhi to give up its nuclear arsenal.The nuclear club holds its annual meeting later this month.",2016-06-07
1515,World Bank slashes global growth forecast to 24 per,"strong>Washington: A worried World Bank slashed its growth forecast for the global economy Tuesday, saying advanced economies are rebounding more slowly than expected and low commodity prices continue to hurt other countries.</strongThe Bank said that the global economy should grow at just 2.4 percent this year, the same lethargic pace of 2015 and much slower than the 2.9 percent it predicted in January.It said that the slow growth in advanced economies is holding back developed countries, with world trade and investment both depressed, and called for Prospects for a pickup ""remain muted,"" the Bank said, in a report especially downbeat for countries dependent on commodity exports like oil.It said risks to growth have risen since the beginning of the year, particularly the high level of borrowing by companies in developing countries, which has left them vulnerable to credit crises as growth stagnates.It also includes the rise in doubts that the aggressive monetary easing in developed countries, with negative interest rates in several, is doing the intended job of firing up economic activity.""Economic growth remains the most important driver of poverty reduction, and that´s why we´re very concerned that growth is slowing sharply in commodity-exporting developing countries due to depressed commodity prices,"" said World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim.""This sluggish growth underscores why it´s critically important for countries to pursue policies that will boost economic growth and improve the lives of those living in extreme poverty.""The report comes as the main developed country drivers of global growth -- Japan, Europe and the United States -- struggle for traction.A sharp deceleration of the US economy since the beginning of the year is not helping carry the rest of the world, and the World Bank has cut its expectations for the world´s largest economy by 0.8 percentage point to 1.9 percent in 2016.The Euro area will achieve only 1.6 percent growth, and Japan, fighting off deflationary pressures, will manage just 0.5 percent.In all three, the bank said, investment remains soft amid doubts about the efficacy of policies, particularly those of central banks holding interest rates at extraordinarily low levels.China, the other major wheel of growth, will manage to hold onto a 6.7 percent pace, but the Bank sees it slowing further to 6.3 percent by 2018.India too is holding onto a good pace, helped by the cheap prices of key commodities it imports, including oil.But other large emerging economies like Brazil and Russia remain locked in recession, and Nigeria and South Africa are expanding very slowly.""Conditions remain markedly challenging for commodity exporters,"" the Bank said.",2016-06-08

A weak dollar can boost demand for crude, which is sold on global markets in the US currency.""A good portion of what we´re seeing during the last couple of days is a reaction to the anticipation the Fed will not change its interest rates and that´s leading to a weaker dollar,"" said James Williams of WTRG Economics.",2016-06-08

""Demand is strong,"" he said, while supplies are starting to look a bit weaker. ""We´re beginning to see a little more interest to the upside.""Oil prices have almost doubled since hitting their lowest level since 2003 in February, helped by declining US output and production cuts in Nigeria, because of rebel unrest, and in Canada, as wildfires ravaged the oil-producing Alberta region.""The existing momentum, the market sentiment, the absence of any bearish news and the still sizeable supply outages suggest that the price rise will continue,"" Commerzbank analysts said in a research note.They noted that investors shrugged off a 10,000 barrel per day rise last week in US crude oil production, the first increase in 13 weeks.",2016-06-10

Italian and Spanish markets, and European bank stocks overall, were headed for their sharpest one-day drops ever.Worries that other EU states could hold their own referendums were compounded by the fact that markets had rallied on Thursday, seemingly convinced the UK would vote to stay in.Britain's big banks took a $100 billion battering, with Lloyds, Barclays and RBS plunging as much as 30 percent.Stocks on Wall Street opened more than 2 percent lower but cut losses after about an hour of trading. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 340.24 points, or 1.89 percent, at 17,670.83, the S&amp;P 500 lost 42.11 points, or 1.99 percent, at 2,071.21 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 116.74 points, or 2.38 percent, at 4,793.31.MSCI's all-country world stock index fell 3.5 percent.Having campaigned to keep the country in the EU, British Prime Minister David Cameron announced he would step down.Results showed a 51.9/48.1 percent split for leaving, setting the UK on an uncertain path and dealing the largest setback to European efforts to forge greater unity since World War Two.More angst came as Scotland's first minister said the option of another vote for her country to split from the UK - rejected by Scottish voters two years ago - was now firmly on the table.The British pound dived by 18 U.S. cents at one point, easily the biggest fall in living memory, to its lowest since 1985.

It plunged 11 percent after the British referendum to a 31-year low of $1.3122 on Monday.The euro was down 0.25 percent at 82.70 pence EURGBP=D4.""It would be far too early to think that tensions have completely eased,"" said Thu Lan Nguyen, currency analyst at Commerzbank.

Markets are now pricing in a 5 percent chance the Federal Reserve will cut rates in July and an 11 percent chance of a cut in September. They discarded any chance of a rate increase this year, according to CME FedWatch.""The UK referendum has only compounded doubts that the Fed will be able to hike rates this year at all, let alone implement the two hikes notionally pencilled-in,"" analysts at Bank of New York Mellon wrote in a note.For Britain, analysts said money markets were almost fully priced for a rate cut by the Bank of England by the end of the year and around a 50 percent chance of one by August, which should keep sterling weak.

1529,US economy looks strong with 287000 jobs added in Ju,"WASHINGTON: US employers added new workers at a surprisingly strong rate in June after an unnerving stall in May, in a clear demonstration of economic resilience, the Labor Department reported Friday.The much better-than-expected numbers gave a boost to markets in the US and Europe, which have been battered down by worries that Britain's vote to withdraw from the European Union will drag down economic growth.Private businesses and government authorities across the United States generated 287,000 new positions last month, 112,000 more than analysts had expected.The strongest hiring was in the health care, hospitality, information and retail sales sectors, while government hiring also picked up.That largely compensated for the poor numbers from May that had shocked policymakers and markets, sending the dollar lower and contributing to the Federal Reserve's decision last month to put off an interest rate hike.The May job creation numbers in fact were revised downward in Friday's data from the original 38,000 reported to just 11,000.June's hiring levels boosted the monthly average of the last three months to a solid 147,000, which economists say is adequate to keep bringing down unemployment overall.""This is a good trend but nothing spectacular. It suggests that hiring has taken a step down since late last year but that job growth is still strong enough to absorb slack in the labor market,"" said analysts at Nomura Global Economics in a client note.""Most important, today's report quells any concerns of a broader economic slowdown in the US.""Markets reacted positively, with the S&amp;P 500 surging 1.5 percent to a fraction shy of an all-time record.In Europe, Frankfurt's DAX index gained 2.2 percent Paris's CAC 40 added 1.8 percent, while in London the FTSE 100 barometer rose 0.9 percent.As analysts said the data increases the chances that the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates at least once before the end of the year, early in the session the dollar jumped and US bond yields, which had plunged in recent weeks, spiked higher.The jobs numbers were not unequivocally good. Wage growth, another indicator of economic strength, slowed slightly, bringing the annual pace for the last three months to 2.5 percent, compared with the 12-month rate of 2.6 percent.And the unemployment rate, which is based on a separate database from the job creation numbers, rose by 0.2 percentage points to 4.9 percent, though still near the lowest level in more than eight years.That rise was mainly due to a large jump in the number of people reported rejoining the workforce, diluting the impact of the hiring surge on the jobless rate.In May the unemployment rate had fallen from 5.0 percent to 4.7 percent after the volatile data showed a huge number of people had dropped out of the labor force. ",2016-07-09
1530,EU takes China to WTO over export curb,"BRUSSELS: The European Union on Tuesday followed the United States to launch a new legal challenge at the World Trade Organization over duties and quotas China imposes on its raw materials exports.The EU said China is violating WTO rules with restrictions on exports of key materials such as graphite, cobalt, chromium and magnesia which help Chinese industry at the expense of European companies and consumers.""We cannot sit on our hands seeing our producers and consumers being hit by unfair trading practices,"" the EU´s top trade official Cecilia Malmstroem said in a statement.The EU launched similar successful actions against China in 2012 and 2014 over rare earths and raw materials like bauxite, zinc and coke.The new challenge targets export restrictions on graphite, cobalt, copper, lead, chromium, magnesia, talcum, tantalum, tin, antimony and indium.""The past two WTO rulings on Chinese export restrictions have been crystal clear -- these measures are against international trade rules,"" Malmstroem said.""As we do not see China advancing to remove them all, we must take legal action,"" she added.In filing a similar action last week before the WTO, the US government said that when China joined the WTO in 2001, it agreed to eliminate such export duties but had failed to follow through on the commitment.The US action covered nine of the 11 materials mentioned in the EU action, excluding chromium and indium.These raw materials are essential for a broad range of industry, from aerospace and car manufacturing to electronics and chemicals.In Washington, the US trade representative´s office said China´s export duties ranged from five to 20 percent, raising prices for overseas buyers while Chinese companies paid much less and had more secure supplies.In addition, the export duties put pressure on non-Chinese manufacturers to shift production, technologies and jobs to China, it said.As with the US challenge, the EU action launches formal consultations with China as a first step to settle the dispute.If the two sides fail to reach a settlement in 60 days, the EU may decide to ask the WTO to establish a panel to determine whether China´s measures are compatible with the Geneva-based body´s rules.The European Commission, the executive arm of the 28-nation EU, is due Wednesday to review trade links with China ahead of a December deadline whereby, under the terms of its WTO accession, the country should be regarded as a normal market economy, not one where the state plays a central role.",2016-07-19

The sanctions were lifted in January.""Investors are wondering: if Iran doesn´t participate in any such discussions, would Saudi Arabia still be amenable?"" Aw said.At around 0700 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in September was down 36 cents, or 0.79 percent, to $45.38 and Brent crude for October dropped 41 cents, or 0.85 percent, to $47.94.Nigerian Petroleum Minister of State Emmanuel Kachikwu in a Twitter post Monday also voiced doubts about output cuts by OPEC.""On oil production cuts by OPEC, optimism on my part is quite sparse,"" he said. OPEC member Nigeria is Africa´s biggest oil exporter.Oil prices had entered a ""bear"" market at the start of the month on oversupply concerns, falling more than 20 percent and closing below $40 a barrel for the first time since April.Any agreement to curb production would help rebalance the crude oil market, where output has been running ahead of demand.""The chances of a deal actually occurring at next month´s OPEC meeting are minimal,"" Angus Nicholson, a strategist at IG Markets, said in an email commentary.""The Saudis are happy to commit to some sort of OPEC-wide supply freeze deal so long as Iran is party to it. And Iran refuses to agree to any deal that will inhibit them from lifting their oil output to pre-sanctions levels.""",2016-08-16

The sanctions were lifted in January.""Investors are wondering: if Iran doesn´t participate in any such discussions, would Saudi Arabia still be amenable?"" Aw said.At around 0700 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in September was down 36 cents, or 0.79 percent, to $45.38 and Brent crude for October dropped 41 cents, or 0.85 percent, to $47.94.Nigerian Petroleum Minister of State Emmanuel Kachikwu in a Twitter post Monday also voiced doubts about output cuts by OPEC.""On oil production cuts by OPEC, optimism on my part is quite sparse,"" he said. OPEC member Nigeria is Africa´s biggest oil exporter.Oil prices had entered a ""bear"" market at the start of the month on oversupply concerns, falling more than 20 percent and closing below $40 a barrel for the first time since April.Any agreement to curb production would help rebalance the crude oil market, where output has been running ahead of demand.""The chances of a deal actually occurring at next month´s OPEC meeting are minimal,"" Angus Nicholson, a strategist at IG Markets, said in an email commentary.""The Saudis are happy to commit to some sort of OPEC-wide supply freeze deal so long as Iran is party to it.

""The big fear is that London will lose a lot of the financial service jobs that has made it such a global financial center.""New York gained $10.3 billion in cross-border investments in the first six months of the year compared with the $6.9 billion that London took in, data from JLL show. In the same year-ago period, London garnered $12.4 billion while $11.3 billion flowed to New York, according to JLL.The 8.9 percent decline in cross-border investment New York experienced is in-line with the roughly 10 percent decline major cities experienced this year when compared to 2015, a stellar year in property investment around the world.Concerns the UK market was coming toward the end of the cycle amid signs pricing was reaching unsustainable levels only partially explains the drop-off in investment flows to Britain, the largest decline since the financial crisis.It is now obvious that people were becoming increasingly nervous about the Brexit vote, Green-Morgan said.Britain is viewed as more investor friendly than the United States because of beneficial tax arrangements. However, underlying property fundamentals - strong demand and not too much supply - must be in place to attract capital, as now is the case for the U.S. office and multifamily real estate sectors.The uncertainties created by Brexit has made investors more cautious about Britain and to a lesser extent about Europe, said Ken McCarthy, senior managing director, regional research director for Tri-State New York at Cushman &amp; Wakefield.

1554,Welspun scandal plummeting Egyptian cotton outpu,"strong>NEW YORK: A scandal involving the alleged sale of falsely labeled Egyptian cotton products by an Indian textile manufacturer to U.S. big box retailers highlights a stiff reality facing the high-end fiber market: there isn't much Egyptian cotton any more.</strongThe shortage of cotton from Egypt, which commands a premium due to its superior quality, creates an incentive to blend it with other types of cotton without disclosing it or to counterfeit the label altogether, cotton traders said, exacerbating a problem that has plagued the industry for years.Welspun India has lost 42 percent of its market value in the three days since Target Corp said it would sever ties with the textile manufacturer, one of the world's largest, accusing it of substituting cheaper, non-Egyptian cotton into sheets and pillowcases.Egyptian cotton is prized because much of it is ""long staple"" or ""extra long staple,"" meaning the length of the cotton fibers is longer, resulting in a finer, lighter more durable fabric and longer-lasting, higher-end clothing.While other countries including the United States and Australia produce larger quantities of high-end cotton than Egypt, cotton from the North African country has retained its prestige because of a long history growing the crop.But Egypt's cotton output has been declining for the past decade after farmers failed to adapt to shifting consumer demand for mass-produced items made from short- or medium-staple fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).The decline has become a full-fledged crisis in recent years after the government removed cash subsidies, and many farmers replaced cotton acreage with rice, the USDA said.Egypt will produce just 160,000 480-lb bales of cotton in 2016/17, down from 1.4 million bales as recently as 2004/05, accounting for less than 0.2 percent of expected global output.This means some products marketed as containing Egyptian cotton almost certainly do not, or are blended with other types of cotton without proper disclosure, said Jordan Lea, chairman and co-owner of cotton merchant Eastern Trading in Greenville, South Carolina.""If you look at the volume of Egyptian goods that are for sale, and you look at the volume of Egyptian cotton that's produced, it would lead one to scratch one's head,"" Lea said.strong>A GOLD SEAL?</strongLong and extra long staple cotton is rare - it makes up just 2.5 percent of annual world cotton production of more than 100 million bales, according to the USDA - and trades at a substantial premium.U.S. extra long staple cotton, or ""pima,"" trades for 152.25 cents per lb, according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, a 125 percent premium over cotton prices on ICE Futures U.S., a contract that accepts cotton of a ""strict low middling staple length"".Ron Lawson, a cotton industry veteran and broker with LOGIC Advisors in Sonoma, California, said he had ""no idea"" what Egyptian cotton prices were, which he said showed how much of a ""novelty"" item the fiber was.Improper labeling of cotton products including clothing and bedding is a violation of the U.S. Textile Act and Rules, which are enforced by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).An FTC spokesman declined to comment on whether the agency was aware of Target's allegations or had started an investigation.Egypt's cotton association appears to be aware of widespread counterfeiting. In April, its executive director told trade publication Home and Textiles Today that it had tested retail products labeled 'Egyptian cotton' and found that 90 percent contained no Egyptian cotton at all.The Cotton Egypt Association lists Welspun as one of just three companies permitted to label its products with the association's ""Gold Seal,"" which was launched earlier this year and is meant to ensure authenticity.Mukesh Saviani, a Welspun executive, told the trade publication in February that the seal was ""an assurance to retailers that they will not get into any compliance issues.""The scandal could leave big box U.S. retailers wary of dealing with products labeled Egyptian cotton, potentially providing a boon to growers of U.S. Pima cotton in places like California and Arizona.""The Supima boys are doing backflips and pirouettes on their desks right now,"" Lawson said, referring to an association that provides a trademark indicating cotton products come from 100 percent American Pima cotton.",2016-08-25

1557,China G20 West derail agend,"strong>BEIJING: China is hoping to cement its standing as a global power when it hosts leaders from the world's biggest economies this weekend, but suspects the West and its allies will try to deny Beijing what it sees as its rightful place on the international stage.</strongEnsuring that this does not happen will be one of President Xi Jinping's priorities, and a key mark of how successful China will judge the G20 summit to be.Beijing wants to use the Sept 4-5 meeting in the tourist hub of Hangzhou to lay out a broad strategy for global growth, but talks are likely to be overshadowed by arguments over everything from territorial disputes to protectionism, diplomats said.""From where China sits, it looks like the Americans are trying to encircle them,"" said a senior Western envoy, describing conversations with Chinese officials ahead of G20 as being dominated by the South China Sea row and an advanced U.S. anti-missile system to be deployed in South Korea.In recent months, China has been incensed by a ruling against its claims in the South China Sea by an international court, a case initiated by Manila but blamed by Beijing on Washington.While China wants to make sure its highest profile event of the year goes off successfully, Xi will be under pressure at home to ensure he is strong in the face of challenges to his authority on issues like the South China Sea, going by reports in state media.China has already made clear it does not want such matters overshadowing the meeting, which will be attended by U.S. President Barack Obama, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and other world leaders.State media has given great play to the idea that G20 is for China to show leadership in shaping global governance rules and forging ahead with sustainable global growth, with the official People's Daily saying this could be one of the G20's most fruitful ever get-togethers.""Let's make cooperation ever higher,"" it wrote in a commentary last week.But the state-run Study Times wrote in mid-August that Western countries were trying to deliberately exclude a rising China and deny it a proper voice on the world stage with schemes like the U.S.-led Trans-Pacific Partnership.""Trying to get back their right to global governance, they are forging a new 'sacred alliance', striving to establish new rules,"" the influential paper, published twice a week by the Central Party School, wrote in a G20 commentary.""These new rules will exclude China.""strong>ANGERED BY BRITAIN, AUSTRALIA</strongOverseas, China has been angered by questions raised by Britain and Australia over strategic Chinese investments in their countries, saying it smacks of protectionism and paranoia.Australia has blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders, while Britain has delayed a $24 billion Chinese-invested nuclear project.But Western officials have their own concerns about access for their companies in China and are increasingly not afraid to talk about it.Joerg Wuttke, the President of the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China, said there has been a change in tone as European officials having been expressing more dissatisfaction with China's overcapacity problems and a lack of reciprocal market access for European companies. ""It has reached the point where people are not afraid to speak up any more. They feel like they have to be tougher in front of their own constituencies,"" Wuttke told Reuters.A European official involved in trade issues with China expressed exasperation at China's attitude on protectionism.""The Chinese would shut you down at once if you said you wanted to buy one of their grids. You wouldn't get to the end of the sentence,"" the official added.None of this will make for plain sailing at G20.""China is angry with almost everyone at the moment,"" said a second Beijing-based Western diplomat familiar with the summit.To be sure, China does want G20 to go smoothly, said a third Western diplomat.""It's very important from the stance of national pride,"" said the diplomat, pointing out it was not uncommon for G20s to be hijacked by issues other than economics.""It's a minefield for China.""strong>JAPAN WORRIES</strongThen there is Japan, a country with which China has been embroiled in disputes for much of the last decade over their wartime past and a spat over a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.Last week, China's top diplomat called on Japan to be ""constructive"" at G20, with the deeper fear in Beijing that Japan is angling to become involved in the South China Sea dispute as well, at the behest of its ally the United States.Wang Youming, the head of the developing countries program at the Foreign Ministry-backed China Institute of International Studies, wrote in the widely-read Chinese tabloid the Global Times that the closer G20 got, the more Japan was trying to cause trouble.""Japan is getting entangled in the South and East China Sea issues, cozying up to the Philippines, and urging China to respect the result of the so-called 'arbitration' case,"" Wang wrote.""Japan is up to its old tricks, and it's hard not to think they are trying to mess things up.""",2016-08-29

The bank expects that they will lead to an outcome similar to those of peer banks which have settled at materially lower amounts.""The US investment bank Goldman Sachs in April agreed to pay more than $5 billion to settle similar allegations.US authorities have accused major banks of misleading investors about the values and quality of complex mortgage-backed securities sold before the 2008 financial crisis.Much of the underlying lending was worthless or fraudulent, delivering billions of dollars in losses to holders of the mortgage bonds when the housing market collapsed, bringing down numerous banks and touching off the country´s worst recession since the 1930s.According to securities filings, Deutsche Bank as of June 30 had set aside $5.5 billion to resolve pending legal matters. In the mortgage-backed securities matter, the bank is aiming for an amount between $2 billion and $3 billion, according to knowledgeable sources.The US Justice Department declined to comment.Bank of America in 2014 paid out nearly $17 billion in a related enforcement action but federal authorities have faced stinging criticism for failing to hold individuals to account.In recent years, Deutsche Bank has found itself mired litigation and enforcement actions around the world.US market regulators last year fined the German lender $55 million, concluding that it had overvalued its holdings of credit derivatives by at least $15 billion during the financial crisis.In 2015 and 2016 Deutsche Bank failed so-called stress tests conducted by the US central bank that were designed to determine whether it had adequate capital strength to weather shocks such as those of the financial crisis.In June, the International Monetary Fund described the bank as a ""major systemic risk,"" leaving its chief executive John Cryan to strive to convince markets that Deutsche Bank was bound to recover.In April of last year, Deutsche Bank also paid a record $2.5 billion to settle American and British charges that it had manipulated the London Interbank Offered Rate, or Libor, affecting commercial interest rates.The bank also settled with the US Fed and New York´s Department of Financial Services of alleged sanctions violations in Syria and Iran.In July Deutsche Bank posted a 98 percent year-on-year drop in second-quarter profits, with net earnings recorded at only $22 million, which Cryan, the bank´s chief, attributed to ""sustained restructuring.""Cryan plans to cut 9,000 jobs worldwide by 2020, while the bank´s share price has fallen to around 10 percent of its pre-crisis value.",2016-09-16
1561,Fed again poised to cut longer run interest rate for,"strong>SAN FRANCISCO/NEW YORK: U.S. Federal Reserve policymakers are set this week to again cut their forecasts for how high interest rates will need to go in an economy where output, productivity and inflation are growing at a slower pace than in past decades.</strongIt would be the fourth time in 15 months that the U.S. central bank has been forced to admit its estimate of this so-called neutral rate was too optimistic, raising questions about the health of the economy in the coming years.The Fed, however, still insists low interest rates and its large balance sheet of bonds are sufficient to continue bolstering economic growth.Conversations with Fed officials suggest some will cut their predictions for the longer-run rate at this week's monetary policy meeting, with the median forecast possibly falling to 2.75 percent. It was 3.75 percent in June 2015 and 4.25 percent four years ago.The Fed is expected to leave its benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged following its two-day meeting on Wednesday, according to a Reuters poll of economists.The Fed's policy rate has been about 0.38 percent since it was raised in December, the first increase in nearly a decade.The expected reduction in the longer-run neutral rate forecast amounts to a lower speed limit on future rate hikes, and points to fewer increases with longer gaps between them than U.S. central bankers and investors had expected.The lower the neutral rate forecast, the less anxious the Fed needs to be about tightening policy, which would justify its repeated decisions to defer rate increases.The result, says San Francisco Fed President John Williams, will be the ""shallowest"" set of rate hikes ever; ""much flatter,"" according to Dallas Fed President Robert Kaplan in a separate conversation, than anything in the past.The Fed has not raised rates this year despite signaling in December that four rate hikes were coming in 2016. That number has since been scaled back to two hikes this year, with another three hikes in 2017, due to a global growth slowdown, financial market volatility and tepid U.S. inflation.But given the new thinking on the neutral rate, that seems overly optimistic.Fed policymakers say an aging U.S. population and decline in productivity growth is sapping economic potential, making them wary about raising rates too fast.""They are not very far from being in a tightening mode,"" said Shehriyar Antia, founder of Macro Insight Group and a former senior analyst at the New York Fed. ""That augers for more patience since the risk of you falling behind with inflation is less because it ain't going to take that much for rates to lean on inflation.""FED TOOLBOXRegardless of any reduction in the neutral rate estimate this week, Fed Chair Janet Yellen is likely to stick with her view that the central bank's so-called toolbox - its more than $4 trillion in Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, low interest rates and planned gradual removal of stimulus - is appropriate for an economy that has consistently fallen short of growth forecasts.During the global central banking conference last month in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, Yellen said that policy mix had served the Fed well and would likely be useful in the face of a future economic downturn.But the Fed's constant walk-backs have served to undercut some of the market's faith in the central bank. Traders of short-term rate futures, for instance, are now betting the Fed will not hike rates until early next year.Still, any cut to the Fed's neutral rate forecast does not mean it will never raise rates.""They want to maintain market expectations for a rate hike in case they want to raise rates in December if conditions warrant one,"" said Sam Bullard, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.The Fed is due to release its policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday and Yellen will hold a press conference shortly after. The Fed's rate-setting committee will meet again in early November and mid-December.",2016-09-20

1564,IMF warns of protectionist threat to global gr,"WASHINGTON: The IMF on Tuesday left its global economic forecasts unchanged into 2017 but called on governments to take action against the threats of low growth and protectionism.With Britain voting to secede from the European Union and US presidential candidates disfavoring open borders, the International Monetary Fund said populist politics imperiled free trade and economic growth.Global output is expected to grow this year by 3.1 percent before rising to 3.4 percent next year, estimates that are unchanged from July, according to the IMF´s new World Economic Outlook report.But the Fund downgraded forecasts both for growth in global trade volume and for advanced economies´ output, saying that prospects for richer countries had darkened this year.The IMF notably cut its outlook for the United States, the world´s largest economy, but upgraded those for Japan and the eurozone.It also called Chinese businesses´ dependence on high levels of credit to bolster growth was ""dangerous"" and unsustainable, creating risks to China´s economic stability in the medium-term.The focus of worries, however, was the sharp rise of talk against free trade pacts and for raising barriers to foreign competition in leading economic powers, including the United States and some European countries.""It is vitally important to defend the prospects for increasing trade integration,"" said IMF chief economist Maurice Obstfeld ""Turning back the clock on trade can only deepen and prolong the world economy´s current doldrums.""The IMF downgraded its outlook for advanced economies this year by 0.2 percentage points to 1.6 percent but raised it slightly for emerging and developing economies to 4.2 percent. Next year´s forecasts were unchanged.The world trade outlook also soured, with growth now pegged at a very low 2.3 percent this year, before rising to 3.8 percent in 2017.The IMF said global growth still faces notable uncertainties, such as further economic shocks in China, a continued fall in commodity prices and the sudden imposition of new trade barriers.""Geopolitical tensions could flare up, adding to the humanitarian crises already afoot in the Middle East and Africa,"" the report said.",2016-10-04
1565,World Banks top economist tipped for Nob,"strong>STOCKHOLM: The World Bank´s new chief economist is among those tipped to win the Nobel Economics Prize on Monday, as the awards season moves into a second week.</strongThe economics prize is unique among the Nobel awards in that it was created by the Swedish central bank in 1968 -- the others were all set up through the 1895 will of Swedish inventor and philanthropist Alfred Nobel.This year, economists working on growth and labour markets are among those vying for the prize, which will be announced on Monday at 11:45 am (0945 GMT).The committee has a tendency to honour pairs or trios of economists, although last year a single laureate, US-British researcher Angus Deaton, was chosen for his groundbreaking work on poverty.Paul Romer -- the US academic, activist and entrepreneur who was appointed chief economist of the World Bank in July -- is favourite to win, according to Sweden´s Dagens Nyheterm newspaper, for his pioneering work on endogenous growth theory.This relatively new area of research tries to incorporate the way that people innovate and develop technologies into models of economic growth.Romer´s employers are certainly rooting for him: last week New York University´s Stern Business School, where he teaches, accidentally published a press release naming him as the winner and inviting journalists to a news conference.The school hastily withdrew the statement and apologised, saying it was merely preparing for a possible win and that it had been published accidentally. ""We are deeply sorry that these routine preparations may appear presumptuous,"" it said.Other names circulating include 94-year-old William Baumol of the US, a labour market specialist, and Indian-born US economist Jagdish Bhagwati, a free trade researcher.Bhagwati has played ""a large if subtle role in keeping protectionism from being respectable,"" according to the 2008 Nobel economics laureate Paul Krugman.Of the 76 economics prize laureates, Americans dominate the list overwhelmingly, with 55 winners.If the Nobel committee were to look elsewhere this year, it could set its sights on France´s Olivier Blanchard, former chief economist at the IMF, or Swedish professor and ex-central banker Lars E.O. Svensson for his work on monetary policy./><strong>- ´Time for a woman´ -</strong Still more Americans have been named as possible winners: Douglas Diamond and Philip Dybvig for their work on financial panic models, or Robert Townsend for his work on risk and insurance in developing economies.Michael Woodford, a monetary theorist currently teaching at Columbia University, and Robert Barro, who researches the factors that determine economic growth, are also mentioned as serious candidates.Women remain largely absent from the list of economics laureates. Only one woman has won the prize -- Elinor Ostrom, in 2009.But French-American Esther Duflo, 43, would be an ideal laureate, according to economist Micael Dahlen, interviewed in Swedish daily Svenska Dagbladet.""It´s high time for a woman to get the prize, for someone under the age of retirement to get it, and because her research is groundbreaking in the fields of poverty and economics, among other things,"" he said.The economics prize is the fifth of the six Nobel prizes to be announced this year.Last week, the awards for medicine, physics, and chemistry were announced, as well as the peace prize, which went to Colombia´s President Juan Manuel Santos for his efforts to end a half-century war with the FARC rebels.The final prize, for literature, will be announced Thursday.For that award, the Swedish Academy could tap a superstar novelist such as Philip Roth of the US or Haruki Murakami of Japan, or a lesser-known writer such as Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse or Syrian poet Adonis.The Nobel prize consists of a diploma, a gold medal and cheque for eight million Swedish kronor (828,000 euros, $928,000), which the laureates will receive at a ceremony in Stockholm on December 10. ",2016-10-10

It´s ´there will be a Brexit in two years and after two years we will have to take decisions.´""<br/>According to Sapin they had already decided ""activities will be transferred to the Continent.""""Those are their words, not mine,"" he said, adding calling it an ""inevitable outcome, whatever the result of the Brexit negotiations"" between London and Brussels.Paris is among several cities hoping to woo London-based financial institutions if banks do decide to base themselves elsewhere in Europe to safeguard their euro business.Sapin said France was working on a plan to promote Paris as a future financial capital.",2016-10-13

However, Afghanistan and Pakistan, stipulate additional hurdles for women entrepreneurs.This year, New Zealand has edged out Singapore as the easiest country for doing business in the latest rankings.The World Bank cited reductions in labor-related taxes and new regulations that make paying taxes easier as key reasons for moving New Zealand to the top spot from its previous runner-up position.Macedonia broke into the coveted top 10, while Brunei had the biggest improvement, moving to 72nd from a rank of 84th last year as it made electricity supply more reliable, passed a new insolvency law and increased protections for minority investors.According to the report, a record 137 economies made reforms to make it easier to start and operate businesses in the last year, with more than 75 percent of the changes occurring in developing countries.Kazakhstan rose to 35th place from 41st, with big weight given to its improvements in business start-up regulations, construction permits and power availability. Rounding out the 10 most-improved countries were Kenya, Belarus, Indonesia, Serbia, Georgia, Pakistan, United Arab Emirates and Bahrain.This year's report tracked gender differences in scores for starting a business, registering property and enforcing contracts, finding discrimination that lowered the scores of 38 economies. Twenty-three of those had more procedures for women than men to start a business, and 16 limited women's ability to own and transfer property.The 184th-ranked Democratic Republic of Congo, for example, requires a married woman to have her husband's authorization to incorporate a business, the study said.The World Bank says better performance in the ""Doing Business"" rankings generally equates to lower levels of income inequality and reduced poverty.""Simple rules that are easy to follow are a sign that a government treats its citizens with respect,"" the World Bank's chief economist, Paul Romer, said in a statement. ""They yield direct economic benefits - more entrepreneurship, more market opportunities for women, more adherence to the rule of law.""Most of the top 10 shifted around a bit, with Denmark staying in third place, Hong Kong edging higher to fourth from fifth, trading places with South Korea, and Norway rising to sixth. The United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden ranked slightly lower.Somalia was rated as the hardest country to do business in the latest survey.",2016-10-26
1569,US markets not fully buying Hillary wi,"strong>NEW YORK: As the US presidential election moves into the home stretch, financial markets are not fully invested in polls that show a win for Hillary Clinton.</strongEven though polls show the Democratic candidate with a strong lead over Republican Donald Trump, analysts say investors are waiting until after November 8 to lay their money on the table.""I don´t think it´s fully 100 percent Clinton is in,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade, who sees a pullback in risk-oriented investments as a sign of investor caution.""Usually people are looking to take on extra risk for reward,"" he said. ""I think this is one case where people are paring back on their risk.""Wall Street is thought to generally favor Clinton over Trump for president, and equity markets have hovered at historically high levels since July, with the S&amp;P 500 less than three percent below its all-time peak.Clinton is considered the more market-friendly outcome, expected to maintain the policies of outgoing President Barack Obama, while the market views Trump as a great unknown, both because of his penchant for controversy and his lack of a record in public office.Trump has attacked trade partners China and Mexico and accused Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen of being a political tool of the Democratic party. Investors are also unsettled by Trump´s seeming embrace of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a sign he may take foreign policy in radical new directions.Signs of nervousness have been seen in certain trades, analysts say, like the Mexican peso. Trump´s pledge of immigration controls and trade restrictions with Mexico have raised worries over its economy.The peso sank against the dollar as Trump´s campaign added momentum, but then rebounded on Clinton´s gains following the first presidential debate on September 26.But it remains down about 9 percent since Trump secured his party´s nomination in May.On the other hand, another gauge of market sentiment has been the biotechnology sector, which is seen as vulnerable in a Clinton presidency given the Democrat´s vow to address runaway drug prices. The Nasdaq biotechnology index has fallen about nine percent over the last month.Some analysts say the markets have already assumed a Clinton victory.""To me, the markets clearly want a Clinton win and they have priced that in,"" said Nathan Thooft, senior managing director at Manulife Asset Management.""That´s what they predict, and that´s what they want. If that doesn´t happen, I feel there´s a great level of uncertainty and possible downside to the markets.""strong>- Some ´complacency´ over Trump -</strongIndeed, investors are aware that Trump has been consistently underestimated by the political, media and business establishment. Many are also loath to repeat the error of Britain´s June referendum to leave the European Union, when polling supported the market bet on a ""stay"" vote, only to be thrown into turmoil when Brexit passed.""There´s a bit of complacency in the market."" said Kathy Lien of BK Asset Management,""I think the market´s underestimating the possibility of things going wrong as a result of either a Trump victory or the possibility of internal strife in the nation as a result of Clinton winning,"" she said.Briefing.com analyst Patrick O´Hare cited sluggish trading volume, as well as the flatness of the S&amp;P 500, as a sign investors are in ""seeing is believing mode"" with respect to polls pointing to a Clinton triumph.One sign of a pickup in caution is the VIX volatility index, also known as the ""fear"" index. The index has risen the last three days and jumped nearly 8 percent Thursday to 15.36. Still, that is far below the 25.76 level on the day after the Brexit shock.A big jump in the VIX before November 8 would signal ""that the market is fearing something odd,"" Kinahan said.",2016-10-28
1570,NY Times sees digital gains but profit evapor,"strong>NEW YORK The New York Times Co. saw profits evaporate in the third quarter due to one-time costs and a steep drop in print advertising revenues, results showed Wednesday.</strongThe prestigious US daily publisher reported a profit of $406,000 -- down 96 percent from the $9.4 million profit in the same period a year ago.Overall revenues fell one percent in the quarter to $363.5 million.The company, struggling to transition to digital, said online ad revenues grew 21.5 percent and now account for more than 35 percent of its advertising receipts.<br/>But that increase failed to offset an 18.5 percent drop in print ad revenues -- a situation faced by most traditional newspaper publishers.Taken together, advertising revenues were down 7.7 percent. The Times added 129,000 paid digital-only subscribers in the quarter. That helped boost digital subscription revenue by 16 percent from a year ago and overall circulation revenue three percent.""This quarter proved yet again that the New York Times has a very compelling digital revenue story to tell,"" said Mark Thompson, president and chief executive officer, in a statement.""We saw exceptional gains in our digital consumer business... more than twice as many as the same quarter last year and far more than any quarter since the pay model launched in 2011.""Thompson added that the company also faced ""real pressure on print advertising both for us and for the rest of the industry.""""We expect print advertising to remain challenged in the fourth quarter and while we will continue innovating and investing where we think it makes sense, we will remain focused on our cost structure and on rapidly growing our digital business,"" he said.The results were hit by one-time costs that included a $2.9 million charge for the closing of its Paris editing and prepress operations and $13 million in severance costs.<br/>The Times this year began a review of its newsroom of 1,300 to realign for the digital era, with a plan expected in the coming weeks.",2016-11-02
1571,Hillary Clinton Wall Street favorite enemy,"strong>WASHINGTON: Hillary Clinton began her presidential campaign by promising to do what it takes to rein in Wall Street.</strongBoosted by Wall Street's toughest critics, U.S. senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, the Democratic candidate has declared ""the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top"" and said she would raise bank fees and tighten banking regulations. She has encouraged regulators to break up too-risky banks.And yet, Wall Street appears unperturbed by the prospect of a Clinton presidency. In fact, the banking industry has supported Clinton with buckets of cash and stocks have sold off on days when the Clinton campaign stumbles. Privately, bankers say that they trust her to remain a pragmatist who will keep the current regulatory regime laid down by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform legislation passed in 2010.I dont think Clinton wakes up thinking about Wall Street,"" one senior banking industry lobbyist said.There are hints in apparently leaked email discussions among Clinton's campaign staff that bankers are not far off the mark when they count on her to tread lightly.Pressed during the campaign by progressive Democrats to call for a revival of the Glass-Steagall Act that would require separation of commercial and investment banking, Clinton ultimately refused. She also weighed another progressive favorite - a tax on financial transactions- but instead recommended a far narrower plan to tax only canceled orders by high speed traders.Ultimately, what bankers most like about Clinton is that she is not Donald Trump.Many financiers fear her unorthodox Republican rival could disrupt global trade, damage geopolitical relationships and rattle markets, industry analysts and participants say.Those are the kind of things that corner offices think about, said Karen Shaw Petrou of Federal Financial Analytics Inc, whose firm advises financial firms about U.S. regulatory policy. The overriding concern about Trump has dominated peoples thinking.""Trump's candidacy has upended traditional political alliances and bankers that usually contribute more to the Republicans have been flinging money at Clinton.Employees of the 17 largest bank holding companies and their subsidiaries have been sending her $10 for every $1 they contributed to Trump, according to a Reuters analysis. In 2012, the same group contributed twice as much to Republican candidate Mitt Romney as it did to President Barack Obama's re-election campaign.strong>DEVIL YOU KNOW</strongPeople who work for hedge funds and private equity firms have contributed more than $56 million to Clintons presidential campaign and the supporting groups that face no legal cap on donations. Trumps campaign and related groups received just $243,000 from donors in the same sector, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.Its basically going with the devil you know over the devil you dont, said Brian Gardner, a managing director of New York investment firm Keefe Bruyette &amp; Woods. What also helped, he said, was the familiarity with Hillary and Bill Clinton dating back to the 1990s when her husband was president and ushered in a period of financial deregulation.There is a closeness and a comfort level between the titans on Wall Street and the Clintons,"" he said.For bankers, the biggest worry is a scenario where Clinton wins and the Democrats take control of the House and the Senate, with progressives such as Warren and Sanders holding sway over everything from new tax laws to appointments of regulators.Already, Warren has called for immediate dismissal of the Securities and Exchange Commission Chair Mary Jo White. Last year, Warren successfully led a movement to derail Obamas plan to appoint banker Antonio Weiss to the top job at Treasury.Warren and other progressives will press Clinton to be tough on Wall Street in return for their campaign support.Clinton ""leaned heavily on Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, and progressive ideas, when she needed to excite voters, Adam Green with the Progressive Change Campaign Committee said. Elizabeth Warren has proven shes a very powerful ally to have on your side. And its well known shes also a formidable opponent to have against you, Green said.However, recent polls suggest it is unlikely that Democrats will take the House and the future of the Senate is far from certain. Even if the Senate goes Democratic, it is likely to be led by New York Senator Chuck Schumer, a moderate who has represented Wall Street with the industry's backing.Clinton has said she will propose a ""risk fee"" on the largest financial firms and tighten up rules which allow banks to circumvent bans on proprietary trading by investing in hedge funds. Like Trump, she has proposed to end the tax break that private equity investors enjoy, termed ""carried interest.""Yet such provisions will be probably tied up in a much larger tax initiative that will involve months, if not a year or more, of horse trading in Washington. Ultimately, it could end up overshadowed by other progressive goals, such as infrastructure funding, college affordability, or raising the minimum wage.Those are the causes that Clinton has prioritized and they are likely to supersede her anti-bank rhetoric, say bankers. One industry trade group representative said: ""We're not in her top 10 to take care of.""",2016-11-02

1574,Trumps surprise wins rattle world mar,"strong>WASHINGTON: Republican Donald Trump scored a series of shocking wins in battleground U.S. states including Florida and Ohio on Tuesday, opening a path to the White House for the political outsider and rattling world markets that had counted on a win by Democrat Hillary Clinton.</strongWith investors worried a Trump victory could cause economic and global uncertainty, the U.S. dollar sank and stock markets plummeted in wild Asian trading. Opinion polls before Election Day had given Clinton a slim lead.Mexico's peso plunged to its lowest-ever levels as Trump's chances of winning the presidency increased. Concerns of a Trump victory have weighed heavily on the peso for months because of his threats to rip up a free trade agreement with Mexico and tax money sent home by migrants to pay to build a wall on the southern U.S. border.Trump surged to wins in Florida, Ohio, Iowa and North Carolina, and Fox News projected a win for him in Wisconsin. With voting completed in 49 of the 50 U.S. states, he also narrowly led in Michigan and New Hampshire, edging him closer to 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the state-by-state fight for the White House.Shortly after Fox called Wisconsin for Trump, supporters at his election evening rally in New York began to chant ""Lock her up"" - a common refrain on the campaign trail for the former U.S. secretary of state repeatedly dubbed ""Crooked Hillary"" by Trump.Clinton still had ways to reach 270 electoral votes, but she would have to sweep the remaining battleground states including Pennsylvania, Michigan and Nevada, and pull off an upset win in Arizona.Trump captured conservative states in the South and Midwest, while Clinton swept several states on the East Coast and Illinois in the Midwest.After running close throughout the night in Virginia, Clinton pulled out the swing state that is home to her running mate, Senator Tim Kaine. But TrumpAt 8:55 p.m. EST, Clinton acknowledged a battle that was unexpectedly tight given her edge in opinion polls going into Election Day.She tweeted: ""This team has so much to be proud of. Whatever happens tonight, thank you for everything.""As of 11:40 p.m. EST, Trump had 244 electoral votes to Clintons 209, with U.S. television networks projecting the winner in 41 of the 50 states and the District of Columbia.A wealthy real-estate developer and former reality TV host, Trump rode a wave of anger toward Washington insiders to challenge Clinton, whose gold-plated establishment resume includes stints as a first lady, U.S. senator and secretary of state.strong>UNPOPULAR CANDIDATES</strongBoth candidates had historically low popularity ratings, although Trump's were worse than Clinton's, in an election that many voters characterized as a choice between two unpleasant alternatives.Before Tuesday's voting, Clinton led Trump, 44 percent to 39 percent in the last Reuters/Ipsos national tracking poll. A Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation poll gave her a 90 percent chance of defeating Trump and becoming the first woman elected U.S. president.Also at stake on Tuesday was control of Congress. Television networks projected Republicans would retain control of the House of Representatives, where all 435 seats were up for grabs.In the Senate, where Republicans were defending a slim four-seat majority, Democrats scored their first breakthrough in Illinois when Republican Senator Mark Kirk lost re-election. But Republicans Rob Portman in Ohio and Marco Rubio in Florida won high-profile Senate re-election fights.In a presidential campaign that focused more on the character of the candidates than on policy, Clinton, 69, and Trump, 70, accused each other of being fundamentally unfit to lead the country.Trump entered the race 17 months ago and survived a series of seemingly crippling blows, many of them self-inflicted, including the emergence in October of a 2005 video in which he boasted about making unwanted sexual advances on women.

1575,US stocks surge as voters head to ,"strong>NEW YORK: US stock markets reversed an early fall Tuesday and surged sharply higher as voters headed to polls to choose between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump for their next president.</strongAdding to Monday´s 2 percent gains, which came as Democrat Clinton´s chances for a victory appeared to improve, the S&amp;P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were up 0.7 percent in early afternoon trade.What caused the sharp mid-morning reversal was unclear; the markets swung almost one percentage point in a short period and the closely-watched Vix volatility index, a signal of market nervousness, fell sharply at the same time.The move came at about the same time a new polling group, Votecastr, released an analysis of early voting in key swing state Florida that showed Clinton ahead of Trump.Votecastr´s analyses are not based on actual voting but extrapolations of observed turnout in Tuesday´s voting compared with actual turnout and vote data from previous elections.But Michael James of Wedbush Securities said there was no single catalyst for the surge higher; it was a continuation of Monday´s momentum.""Yesterday was probably the best single day we´ve had in six months. Buyers were poised to buy at any pull-back and that is exactly what happened.""Markets have shown a clear preference for Clinton, given Trump´s promises to shake up US economic policy and his controversial foreign policy statements. Clinton´s prospects for a win gained after the weekend statement by FBI director James Comey that cleared Clinton of wrongdoing over a long investigation into her private email server.At 1 pm (1800 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average stood at 18,393.62, up 0.7 percent.The broad-based S&amp;P 500 added 0.7 percent to 2,146.46, while the tech-rich Nasdaq Composite Index jumped 0.9 percent to 5,213.59.",2016-11-09

1577,World Bank praises Pak progress restoring macroeconomic stability,"strong>WASHINGTON: A new World Bank report has praised Pakistan continuing progress in restoring macroeconomic stability, saying it was ready to support the governments reforms agenda to help spread its benefits more widely.</strongAfter achieving macroeconomic stability, the government continued to deliver on its structural reform agenda in FY16, but much remains to be done if growth is to be strengthened and sustained, the report said.The Pakistan Development Update report which is released twice a year, noted 4.7 economic growth in 2015-16 financial year, being the highest in eight years and projected the growth to accelerate to 5.4 percent in FY18, according to a statement issued here. In the medium-term, Pakistans growth is expected to continue to accelerate, reaching 5 percent in FY17.Pakistan continues to make good progress in restoring macroeconomic stability. Building on this Pakistan needs to push forward with deeper structural reforms that spread benefits more widely, and the World Bank stands ready to support the reforms agenda, says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.Pakistans growth was driven by domestic consumption that continues to compensate for weak global demand. The report warned that Pakistans low rates of investment and declining export competitiveness, however, remain a concern.The report said that growth acceleration will depend on the implementation of structural reforms, such as energy and taxation and implementation of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).In the long term, growth will be driven by increased investment in both physical and human capital, with increased focus on better nutrition, health and education outcomes.Pakistan has made significant progress in reducing poverty over the last decade. Based on the revised poverty line adopted in early 2016, the percentage of people living below the poverty line decreased from 64.3 percent in FY02 to 29.5 percent in FY14, the report said. This reduction in poverty is corroborated when analyzing other data, such as asset ownership, says Muhammad Waheed, Senior Economist and lead author of the report.Projected even higher growth in FY18, the report also expects a moderate increase in investment (related to CPEC projects) will to contribute to an acceleration of growth, which will continue to be driven by public and private consumption.Pakistans growth in FY16 was driven by strong domestic demand.Consumption accounted for an overwhelming 92 percent of GDP in FY16, and contributed 7 percentage points towards GDP growth, supported by sustained growth in remittances.Strong aggregate demand and improving business sentiments were evident in private sector credit growth of 12 percent, expanding by Rs. 461 billion in FY16 compared with Rs. 224 billion in FY15, the report said. Low inflation and low interest rates also contributed to higher credit growth.The governments efforts to stabilize the macroeconomic environment provided a better footing for economic activity, while marginal improvements in energy supplies facilitated manufacturing growth in particular, the report added.The World Banks 2017 Doing Business report found that Pakistan improved four ranks in 2017, placing it among the top ten most improved countries. Revenue growth is underpinning the falling deficit, driven in FY16 by a 20 percent increase in the Federal Board of Revenues (FBR) collection.A series of new tax measures in the FY17 budget will broaden the tax base and are expected to contribute to another significant increase in FBR revenues. On the expenditure side, the development budget has grown faster than the recurrent budget.In the FY17 budget, an expected reduction in state-owned enterprise subsidies and interest payments has created space for an increase in infrastructure spending, including on CPEC projects.  ",2016-11-11
1578,Oil wars how Kremlin 13 billion Indian deal fell apar,"strong>LONDON/NEW DELHI/MOSCOW: A multi-billion-dollar Russian deal to buy Indian refiner Essar was nearly sunk at the eleventh hour by a rival bid from Saudi Arabia as the two oil superpowers vie for supremacy across the world.</strongThe deal between Essar and a consortium led by Kremlin oil giant Rosneft appeared dead in the water two months ago after Saudi state energy firm Aramco weighed in, according to seven Russia, India and Saudi-based industry sources familiar with or involved in the negotiations.It was salvaged due to the involvement of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who were keen for it go through, and after the consortium agreed to pay $13 billion - more than double what Rosneft had initially valued Essar at, sources told Reuters.This made the refiner the biggest-ever foreign acquisition in India and Russia's largest outbound deal.The tussle for Essar - a state-of-the-art plant in the world's fastest-growing fuel market - illustrates the growing battle for oil markets between Russia and Saudi Arabia, the world's two largest crude exporters.It also sheds light on the challenges OPEC member Saudi Arabia and non-OPEC Russia - which are also fighting a proxy conflict in Syria's civil war - will face in trying to clinch a global agreement to limit output growth to prop up oil prices.The full details of how the Essar deal was struck remain unclear. Two industry sources said it was rescued thanks to the involvement of Putin and Modi while three other sources said Rosneft had simply outbid Saudi Aramco.Officials in Modi's office declined to comment while Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov denied there was any Kremlin intervention in the deal.""Naturally, we defend the interests of our companies. Of course we lobby for them, especially on such large deals,"" said Peskov, but added that in the case of Essar ""there were no orders from the Kremlin"".""It was a corporate decision by Rosneft to gain synergies via cooperation with India,"" he said.Rosneft and Saudi Aramco declined to comment.Essar said it had held discussions with several potential buyers but had gone with the Rosneft consortium because their offer was considered the most attractive. It denied there was any intervention from Putin or Modi.strong>SHOWDOWN</strongRosneft boss Igor Sechin is keen to buy refining assets around the world to guarantee outlets for Russian oil. He had been negotiating since 2014 to buy 49 percent of Essar from its owners, Indian brothers Ravi and Shashi Ruia, and the two parties had been in exclusive talks since July 2015 when a preliminary deal was signed.While the exact amount Rosneft was prepared to offer for the stake at that stage is unclear, Russian and Indian industry sources said it valued the whole of Essar at about $5.7 billion.However it became apparent that there were problems with the deal in early September, when Sechin travelled to India to meet the Ruia brothers, flying from Hangzhou, China, where he had been part of Putin's G20 summit delegation.Sechin walked into the meeting with the Ruia brothers soon after landing in India at 1 a.m., determined to close the deal, according to sources briefed on the discussions.As the meeting started, one of the brothers told Sechin the deal process had been going on for too long, the exclusivity period had expired in July and Essar was now talking to other parties.Those other parties included Saudi Aramco, he said.According to the sources familiar with how the meeting unfolded, Sechin responded by saying that if Essar walked away from the deal it risked losing Russian financial and oil-supply support.The Ruia brothers then said the talks with Rosneft were over and called an abrupt end to the meeting.""People started leaving the room, embarrassed,"" one of the sources said. Another source said the Essar management had drafted a statement to say the deal with Rosneft was off.Rosneft and Essar declined to comment on what transpired at the meeting, or on whether such a statement had existed. Sechin and the Ruia brothers could not be reached for comment.Three Saudi-based sources familiar with details of talks between Essar and Saudi Aramco said the firm was seriously considering buying Essar. One of the sources said Aramco was prepared to pay up to $9 billion for all or most of the refiner.Aramco declined to comment on whether it had made a bid.strong>TOO BIG TO FAIL</strongIn the end, however, the Rosneft-Essar deal proved to be too big to fail.For India, a deal collapse or a delay because of talks with another party would set back Modi's drive to clean up India's $140 billion mountain of bad debt given Essar's multi-billion-dollar debts to local and foreign banks after years of rapid expansion.For Russia, the deal in the huge Indian market represented an important milestone in building a global oil empire despite Western sanctions imposed on Russia over its actions in Ukraine.Facing the Saudi competition, Rosneft formed a consortium that bought 98 per cent of the refiner plus a fuel terminal for $13 billion. The Kremlin oil firm bought 49 percent - below the 50 percent level that would have fallen foul of Western sanctions - with Swiss trading house Trafigura and Russian private investment group UCP buying the other 49 percent.According to the Indian and Russian industry sources, Rosneft and Essar returned to the negotiating table within days of the spat in early September, and the deal was finally struck.One of the sources said there was a fierce battle between Essar and Rosneft over the terms. They said the Russian-led consortium was forced to outbid the Saudi offer, which they said comprised a combination of cash, long-term low interest credit and oil supplies.Trafigura declined to comment on how the deal came together, while UCP did not reply to a written request asking for comment. Washington said the deal did not violate sanctions.The deal was signed in Mauritius on Oct. 14, a day before a formal announcement on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in Goa where Putin and Modi met. The leaders also oversaw the signing of a raft of other transactions including India agreeing to pay $5 billion for Russian long-range air defence missile systems.Two industry sources said the Essar deal had first been discussed by Putin and Modi as far back as May 2014 on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Russia's main investor show.It was unclear what form - if any - high-level government intervention might have taken after the September dispute.But the two sources said that without political will in Moscow and New Delhi, an agreement could not have been struck.""Putin and Modi saved that deal,"" said one.",2016-11-16

""Openness is vital for the prosperity of the Asia-Pacific.""In the face of Trump´s protectionist rhetoric, he vowed China ""will not shut its door to the outside world, but open it even wider.""""We will fully involve ourselves in economic globalization by supporting the multi-lateral trading regime, advancing the FTAAP and working for the early conclusion of the negotiations on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership,"" he said.China describes RCEP as a stepping stone toward FTAAP, a vast plan that would include all 21 APEC members and is expected to take years, if it happens at all.The meeting of APEC, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of the world´s population and nearly 60 percent of the global economy, is US President Barack Obama´s last foreign visit before handing over to Trump on January 20.Obama and Xi, the leaders of the world´s top two economies, were due to hold their last meeting later Saturday.",2016-11-19

Uncertainty over whether OPEC will agree to cut production at the group's meeting next week weighed on crude prices.Expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's promises of tax cuts, higher infrastructure spending and reduced regulation would benefit certain industries, including banking, industrials and healthcare, have underpinned multiple recent all-time highs in U.S. shares.""While many stocks have risen quite briskly, investors are looking for some forgotten names in the rally,"" said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.MSCI's all-country world equity index was last up 1.86 points, or 0.45 percent, at 414.99.The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 68.96 points, or 0.36 percent, at 19,152.14.

But restaurants in Italy came out best on value for money.Savoy´s restaurant in la Monnaie, the old French national mint on the Left Bank of the River Seine, is famous for its artichoke soup with black truffle and filo pastry mushroom brioche and ""cold steamed"" blue lobster. His 18-course ""Innovations and Inspirations"" menu costs 490 euros ($520) without wine.It was the top-rated French restaurant last year coming in fourth place in the La Liste, which was set up as a ""more scientific and reliable"" rival to the British-based 50 Best Restaurants ranking.Savoy -- who trained the volcanic British chef Gordon Ramsay and remains his mentor -- controversially did not make the 50 Best this year. Nor did Kenichiro Nishi of Kyo Aji, whom La Liste called ""the undisputed master of kaiseki"", the traditional multi-course Japanese dinner.French-born Ripert, 51, a Buddhist who picked up his Emmys for his PBS show ""Avec Eric"", already holds the maximum three Michelin stars.La Liste bills itself as a ""guide of the guides"", pulling together reviews from almost 400 guide books, newspapers and online sites from TripAdvisor to the New York Times and the prestigious Michelin rankings. But tragedy struck the first winner Franco-Swiss chef Benoit Violier, who killed himself a month after winning for the Hotel de Ville at Crissier near Lausanne in Switzerland.Savoy, 63, a three-Michelin-starred chef, comes from humble origins. His father was a municipal gardener in the small town of Bourgoin-Jailleu near Lyon in eastern France where his mother ran a fast-food ""buvette"".He later trained as a chocolate maker before being taken on as an apprentice by the legendary Troisgros brothers for their restaurant in nearby Roanne.La Liste´s founder Philippe Faure, the head of the French tourist board, has accused the 50 Best of consistently ""denigrating"" French restaurants in its listing.While 50 Best has repeatedly denied the charge, no French restaurants have made its top 10 for the last few years.Faure said his listing was compiled impartially from a rigorous mathematical analysis of hundreds of guides and thousands of reviews.La Liste has now also launched a smartphone application in six languages aimed at international travellers for its 1,000 top-rated restaurants in the world, plus the 10,000 eateries which its analysis found to be the best value. ",2016-11-30

Not going to happen,"" Trump told workers at the Carrier plant in Indianapolis in his first major public remarks since winning the White House.""They can leave from state to state, and negotiate deals with different states, but leaving the country will be very, very difficult,"" Trump added.During the presidential campaign, the Republican billionaire threatened to slap tariffs on firms that decamped for places like Mexico or Asia where labor costs are cheaper. It became a repeated refrain of his victorious campaign.Trump specifically singled out Carrier, a brand of United Technologies Corporation, saying he had been encouraging the company not to shift thousands of jobs to Mexico.If they did, he said his administration would impose major tariffs on Carrier products as they made their way back into the United States.""But I called Greg (Hayes, UTC´s chairman) and I said it´s really important, we have to do something because you have a lot of people leaving and you have to understand we can´t allow this to happen anymore with our country,"" Trump said as he recalled an early exchange with the firm´s top executive.Under a deal hammered out with the help of Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who is Indiana´s outgoing governor, the state offered Carrier $7 million in incentives over 10 years, ""contingent upon factors including employment, job retention and capital investment,"" the company said in a statement.Pence said the deal will keep about 1,100 jobs in ""the heart of the heartland.""""This is a great day for Indiana and it´s a great day for working people all across the United States of America,"" Pence said.The deal is seen as an extraordinary industry intervention by a president-elect.His supporters have described it as the first tangible part of Trump´s jobs creation plan.But liberal Senator Bernie Sanders, who challenged Hillary Clinton for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said the deal should worry Americans.Carrier ""took Trump hostage and won,"" Sanders said in an op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post.Trump ""endangered"" other US jobs, Sanders said, ""because he has signalled to every corporation in America that they can threaten to offshore jobs in exchange for business-friendly tax benefits and incentives.""",2016-12-02

Trump campaigned against the overregulation of business and is expected to be more open to mergers than President Barack Obama.The investment announced Tuesday would come from the $100 billion investment fund SoftBank Chief Executive Masayoshi Son is setting up with Saudi Arabias sovereign-wealth fund and other potential partners, according to the Wall Street Journal.Trump made the announcement in the lobby of Trump Tower in Manhattan where he met with the head of SoftBank, a $68 billion telecommunications and tech investment behemoth.""Ladies and gentlemen, this is Masa from SoftBank of Japan, and hes just agreed to invest $50 billion in the United States and 50,000 jobs,"" Trump said.""He would never do this had we (Trump) not won the election!"" Trump later Tweeted.Prior to the election, SoftBank said Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) would be the lead partner in the fund and could invest up to $45 billion over the next five years. SoftBank expects to put in at least $25 billion. Several other large, unnamed investors are in talks on their participation and could bring the total size of the new fund up to $100 billion, SoftBank said.Son, who wore a red tie and red sweater under his suit jacket, told reporters his company would create jobs by investing in startup companies in the United States.""We are going to invest $50 billion into the U.S. and commit to create 50,000 new jobs,"" Son said, adding that he saw a lot of ""deregulation"" under a Trump administration.Trump and Son did not give a timeline for the investment. Trump's four-year term will begin after his Jan. 20 inauguration.U.S.-listed shares of SoftBank gained 3 percent to $30.99.Son had hoped to merge Sprint with T-Mobile US to take on U.S. market leaders AT&amp;T Inc and Verizon Communications Inc.Shares of Sprint briefly reached their highest level in 2-1/2 years, soon after Son's comments. They closed up 1.5 percent to $8.17 in heavy trading, ending well below session highs. Shares of T-Mobile US were up 1.8 percent at $55.99.It was not immediately clear how much of SoftBank's investment had been disclosed before. Softbank said on Nov. 7, the day before the U.S. election, it planned to make future large-scale investments via the $100 billion tech fund, rather than on its own, to avoid growing already-bloated debt.Whether or not Trump's election led to SoftBank's planned investment, the billionaire's victory has been a boon to stock investors. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at another record level on Tuesday, its 11th new high since the Nov. 8 vote.Should the SoftBank fund grow as large as $100 billion, it would be one of the world's largest private equity investors and a potential kingpin in the technology sector.SoftBank has also been stepping up investment in new areas.

1587,US dollar holds near 14 year hig,"strong>NEW YORK: The U.S. dollar edged lower against a basket of major currencies on Friday, but still held near 14-year highs touched after Wednesday's Federal Reserve meeting, with profit-taking halting the greenback's rally.</strongThe dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of six major rivals, was last at 102.900, not far from Thursday's 14-year high of 103.560 but down 0.12 percent on the day.The index gained 1.2 percent on Thursday to mark its biggest daily percentage gain in nearly six months a day after the U.S. central bank raised interest rates for the first time in a year. The Fed also signaled it was likely to hike rates three more times in 2017, up from the two increases forecast at the central bank's September meeting.The projections, combined with expectations that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's incoming administration may boost domestic economic growth with fiscal stimulus, sent the dollar shooting higher and brought parity with the euro back in play.Profit-taking ahead of the weekend and expectations of a squeeze on dollar liquidity heading into year-end dampened the dollar's gains on Friday, analysts said.""The scale of the move since the FOMC meeting has been significant, and you would expect to see some kind of profit-taking on dollar longs,"" said David Gilmore, partner at FX Analytics in Essex, Connecticut.The euro was last up 0.2 percent against the dollar at $1.0433 after hitting a nearly 14-year low of $1.0364 on Thursday, with the current level putting it about 4 percent away from parity with the dollar. The dollar was down 0.2 percent against the yen at 117.94 yen after hitting a roughly 10-1/2 month high of 118.66 yen on Thursday.Despite Friday's losses, the dollar remained on track to notch its biggest weekly percentage gains against the euro, yen, and Swiss franc in four weeks. The euro was on track to decline 1.2 percent against the dollar, while the dollar was set to gain 2.2 percent against the yen and about 1 percent against the Swiss franc for the week.""Were probably starting to thin out for the holidays as well,"" said Win Thin, global head of emerging market currency strategy at Brown Brothers Harriman in New York.Against the Swiss franc, the dollar was last down 0.3 percent at 1.0268 francs after touching 1.0344 francs on Thursday, its highest since August 2010.",2016-12-17

1589,US fines Goldman Sachs 120 mn in rate rigging scand,"strong>WASHINGTON: US regulators fined Goldman Sachs $120 million Wednesday for attempting to manipulate a widely-used global interest rate benchmark to benefit its trading positions.</strongGoldman Sachs traders between 2007 and 2012 deliberately timed and priced trades to influence the published price of the benchmark interest rate, the US Commodities Futures Trading Commission said in a statement.Goldman, one of a group of banks whose data set the benchmark daily, also made false submissions to skew the rate at the expense of counterparties, the CFTC said.The US Dollar International Swaps and Derivates Association Fix is a daily benchmark used for a wide range of financial products, such as interest-rate swaps and derivatives.In addition, the company´s cooperation ""was not satisfactory"" prior to the latter stages of the investigation, the CFTC added.The agency previously fined Citigroup and Barclays for attempted manipulation of the same benchmark interest rate.""This matter, the third enforcement action relating to the (benchmark), demonstrates the breadth of this kind of misconduct across the industry, and within Goldman, the extent of the misconduct across trading desks and product lines,"" said CFTC director of enforcement Aitan Goelman.Besides paying the fine, Goldman´s supervisor for trading on interest-rate products must attest to the effectiveness of remedies to fix the problem.In a separate case,, the Swiss Competition Commission earlier Wednesday hit eight large global banks a total fine of nearly $100 million for rigging international rates between 2005 and 2010.

1590,US acting as global policeman for financial cri,"strong>WASHINGTON: Handing out multibillion-dollar fines right and left to domestic and foreign financial giants, the United States has taken on the role of the unforgiving global cop of the business world.</strongIn stark contrast to the relative inertia of white-collar law enforcement in Europe, Washington most recently brought the hammer down on Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, which sold junk-filled, mortgage-backed securities ahead of the 2008 financial meltdown.Deutsche Bank has agreed to a payout of $7.2 billion, while Credit Suisse settled for $5.3 billion to resolve American authorities´ allegations and avoid the lengthy headache of a trial.Instead of dragging financial firms to court, the US has taken them to the cashier.American giants have not been spared: JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America collectively have shelled out $40 billion to settle cases linked to toxic, crisis-era financial products.""There´s a kind of fundamentalism to US law,"" said Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel and the Washington-based Peterson Institute.""If you break the law, punishment comes down.""- Justice without borders -To be sure, British authorities have taken action over the Libor interest rate manipulation scandal but such retribution remains rare in the rest of Europe.""It isn´t so much a difference in the rules as in the manner in which they are applied. Things are much more severe in the United States,"" Veron told AFP, adding that European countries ""do not dare"" punish their national flagship companies.The American legal framework nevertheless offers the United States the means to extend the long arm of the law well beyond its borders.In the most recent cases, the United States imposed $2.6 billion in criminal penalties on the Brazilian construction conglomerate Odebrecht -- most of which will be paid to Brazil -- and a half billion on the Israeli generic drugmaker Teva Pharmaceutical. Both matters involved corruption occurring outside the United States.The United States pioneered the prosecution of such foreign bribery cases, adopting the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act in 1977 in the wake of the Watergate scandal, which allows US officials to hunt down corrupt payments abroad when the companies involved are traded on Wall Street or are otherwise exposed to US jurisdiction.In the decades since, member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have adopted similar laws but do not enforce them with the same vigor or frequency.Given the means and opportunity to apply its laws ""extraterritorially"" with such regularity, the United States has become a kind of worldwide anticorruption police force, and buttressed its geopolitical influence.""There´s a real nexus between economics and foreign affairs,"" said Aaron Klein, head of the center on regulation and markets at the Brookings Institution in Washington.""The next war is more likely to be fought with bonds than with bombs.""- Making Apple pay -In a different kind of case, Volkswagen´s sprawling emissions-cheating scandal also has shown the might of the US legal system and its ability to bring major companies to task.To compensate drivers and repair damage to the environment, the giant German automaker has agreed to pay out more than $15 billion so far, and doubtless will have to pay more before putting the scandal behind it. But the company still could face criminal charges.<br/>In Europe, authorities have also opened investigations into Volkswagen but by their own admission, the results will be much less spectacular.""In the European Union, the way to damages is more complicated than in the United States,"" EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova said in September.In the United States, authorities can be supported in their actions by so-called class-action lawsuits brought collectively by groups of private individuals who have been wronged, which can ratchet up pressure on companies. But this option does exist in Europe.European authorities meanwhile have not been completely dormant in dealing with major companies. They have opened numerous anti-trust investigations and intensified their pursuit of tax avoidance and evasion by multinational companies.Making perhaps its biggest splash to date, the European Commission at the end of August directed the iPhone maker Apple to pay 13 billion euros ($13.5 billion) in back taxes to Ireland, drawing the ire of a sizeable player: the United States.",2016-12-29

1592,World food prices fall in 2016 for fifth straight year,"strong>NEW YORK: World food prices fell for a fifth straight year in 2016 as losses in cereals, meat and dairy outweighed rises in sugar and vegetable oils, the United Nations food agency said on Thursday.</strongPrices remained stable in December from the month before, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) main food price index, which has edged up steadily after hitting a seven-year low in January.The full year 2016 logged a 1.5 percent annual drop in the index, which measures monthly changes for a basket of cereals, oilseeds, dairy products, meat and sugar.December's reading of 171.8 points versus 171.9 points in November resulted from strong gains in vegetable oils and dairy largely offsetting falls in sugar and meat, the FAO said.Sugar prices rose by about a third across the year, despite an 8.6 percent dip in December that mainly stemmed from a weaker Brazilian real against the dollar and an expected jump in production in Brazil's main sugarcane-growing region.""Economic uncertainties, including movements in exchange rates, are likely to influence food markets even more ... this year,"" FAO senior economist Abdolreza Abbassian said.Cereal prices steadily declined during the year, ending 39 percent below their 2011 peak.Vegetable oil prices reached their highest since July 2014 in December. Palm oil rose on low global inventory levels and tight supplies, while soy oil quotations were boosted by the prospect of rising use for biodiesel in North and South America.",2017-01-12
1593,China posts worst export fall since 2009,"strong>BEIJING: China's massive export engine sputtered for the second year in a row in 2016, with shipments falling in the face of persistently weak global demand and officials voicing fears of a trade war with the United States that is clouding the outlook for 2017.</strongIn one week, China's leaders will see if President-elect Donald Trump makes good on a campaign pledge to brand Beijing a currency manipulator on his first day in office, and starts to follow up on a threat to slap high tariffs on Chinese goods.Even if the Trump administration takes no concrete action immediately, analysts say the specter of deteriorating U.S.-China trade and political ties is likely to weigh on the confidence of exporters and investors worldwide.The world's largest trading nation posted gloomy data on Friday, with 2016 exports falling 7.7 percent and imports down 5.5 percent. The export drop was the second annual decline in a row and the worst since the depths of the global crisis in 2009.It will be tough for foreign trade to improve this year, especially if the inauguration of Trump and other major political changes limit the growth of China's exports due to greater protectionist measures, the country's customs agency said on Friday.""The trend of anti-globalization is becoming increasingly evident, and China is the biggest victim of this trend,"" customs spokesman Huang Songping told reporters.""We will pay close attention to foreign trade policy after Trump is inaugurated president, Huang said. Trump will be sworn in on Jan. 20.China's trade surplus with the United States was $366 billion in 2015, according to U.S. customs data, which Trump could seize on in a bid to bring Beijing to the negotiating table to press for concessions, economists at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said in a recent research note.A sustained trade surplus of more than $20 billion against the United States is one of three criteria used by the U.S. Treasury to designate another country as a currency manipulator.China is likely to point out that its own data showed the surplus fell to $250.79 billion in 2016 from $260.91 billion in 2015, but that may get short shrift in Washington.""Our worry is that Trumps stance towards Chinas trade could bring about long-term structural weakness in Chinas exports,"" economists at ANZ said in a note.""Trumps trade policy will likely motivate U.S. businesses to move their manufacturing facilities away from China, although the latters efforts in promoting high-end manufacturing may offset part of the loss.""On Wednesday, China may have set off a warning shot to the Trump administration. Beijing announced even higher anti-dumping duties on imports of certain animal feed from the United States than it proposed last year.""Instead of caving in and trying to prepare voluntary export restraints like Japan did with their auto exports back in the 1980s, we believe China would start by strongly protesting against the labeling with the IMF, but not to initiate more aggressive retaliation ... immediately,"" the BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research report said.""That said, even a 'war of words' could weaken investor confidence not only in the U.S. and China, but globally.""CHINA'S DECEMBER EXPORTS FALLChina's December exports fell by a more-than-expected 6.1 percent on-year, while imports beat forecasts slightly, growing 3.1 percent on its strong demand for commodities which has helped buoy global resources prices.An unexpected 0.1 percent rise in shipments in November, while scant, had raised hopes that China was catching up to an export improvement being seen in some other Asian economies.China reported a trade surplus of $40.82 billion for December, versus November's $44.61 billion.While the export picture has been grim all year, with shipments rising in only two months out of 12, import trends have been more encouraging of late, pointing to a pick-up in domestic demand as companies brought in more raw materials from iron ore to copper to help feed a construction boom.China imported record amounts of crude oil, iron ore, copper and soybeans in 2016, plus large volumes of coal used for heating and in steelmaking.""Trade protectionism is on the rise but China is relying more on domestic demand,"" said Wen Bin, an economist at Minsheng Bank in Beijing.Prolonged weakness in exports has forced China's government to rely on higher spending and massive bank lending to boost the economy, at the risk of adding to a huge pile of debt which some analysts warn is nearing danger levels.Data next Friday is expected to almost certainly show that 2016 economic growth hit Beijing's target of 6.5-7 percent thanks to that flurry of stimulus.But signs are mounting that the red-hot property market may have peaked, meaning China may have less appetite this year for imports of building-related materials.""It is hard to see what could drive a more substantial recovery in Chinese trade,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, China Economist at Capital Economics, wrote in a note.""Further upside to economic activity, both in China and abroad, is probably now limited given declines in trend growth. Instead, the risks to trade lie to the downside...,"" he said, saying the chance of a damaging China-U.S. trade spat has risen since Trump's appointment of hardliners to lead trade policy.A decline in China's trade surplus in 2016, to just under $510 billion from $594 billion in 2015, may also reduce authorities' ability to offset capital outflow pressures, which have helped drive its yuan currency to more than eight-year lows, ANZ economists said.",2017-01-13

1595,World eight richest wealthy half humanity Oxfam tells Dav,"strong>DAVOS, SWITZERLAND: Just eight individuals, all men, own as much wealth as the poorest half of the world's population, Oxfam said on Monday in a report calling for action to curtail rewards for those at the top.</strongAs decision makers and many of the super-rich gather for this week's World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, the charity's report suggests the wealth gap is wider than ever, with new data for China and India indicating that the poorest half of the world owns less than previously estimated.Oxfam, which described the gap as ""obscene"", said if the new data had been available before, it would have shown that in 2016 nine people owned the same as the 3.6 billion who make up the poorest half of humanity, rather than 62 estimated at the time.In 2010, by comparison, it took the combined assets of the 43 richest people to equal the wealth of the poorest 50 percent, according to the latest calculations.Inequality has moved up the agenda in recent years, with the head of the International Monetary Fund and the Pope among those warning of its corrosive effects, while resentment of elites has helped fuel an upsurge in populist politics.Concern about the issue was highlighted again in the WEF's own global risks report last week.""We see a lot of hand-wringing - and clearly Trump's victory and Brexit gives that new impetus this year - but there is a lack of concrete alternatives to business as usual,"" said Max Lawson, Oxfam's head of policy.""There are different ways of running capitalism that could be much, much more beneficial to the majority of people.""strong>SUPER-CHARGED CAPITALISM</strongOxfam called in its report for a crackdown on tax dodging and a shift away from ""super-charged"" shareholder capitalism that pays out disproportionately to the rich.While many workers struggle with stagnating incomes, the wealth of the super-rich has increased by an average of 11 percent a year since 2009.Bill Gates, the world's richest man who is a regular at Davos, has seen his fortune rise by 50 percent or $25 billion since announcing plans to leave Microsoft in 2006, despite his efforts to give much of it away.While Gates exemplifies how outsized wealth can be recycled to help the poor, Oxfam believes such ""big philanthropy"" does not address the fundamental problem.""If billionaires choose to give their money away then that is a good thing. But inequality matters and you cannot have a system where billionaires are systematically paying lower rates of tax than their secretary or cleaner,"" Lawson said.Oxfam bases its calculations on data from Swiss bank Credit Suisse and Forbes. The eight individuals named in the report are Gates, Inditex founder Amancio Ortega, veteran investor Warren Buffett, Mexico's Carlos Slim, Amazon boss Jeff Bezos, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg, Oracle's Larry Ellison and former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg.",2017-01-16
1596,Global stocks gain as Wall Street eyes Trump inaugurati,"NEW YORK: Most major stock indices posted gains on Wednesday while Wall Street appeared to have little steam, with the vaunted Dow finishing lower for a fourth straight trading session.The US dollar recovered against its major peers after taking a battering the previous day, while the pound fell back having surged on the UK´s Brexit plans.New December economic data in the United States, including an uptick in industrial production and gains in consumer prices, failed to move investors in any direction.Chris Low of FTN Financial said investors were likely waiting to see what they can learn from Friday´s inaugural address by President-elect Donald Trump, who has not so far provided any specifics about an anticipated economic stimulus package.""It seems to be pretty sleepy,"" he said of the US stock market.The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.1 percent while Frankfurt saw strong gains and London, which had been moving in opposite directions from the pound, rose 0.4 percent, recouping some of the previous day´s losses following Prime Minister Theresa May said she was readying Britain to leave the EU´s single market.""We view the move in the British pound following the Prime Minister´s speech as a game-changer and as such don´t anticipate a near-term resumption of the record winning streak for the FTSE 100,"" he said.Paris posted a slight loss at the close.The greenback´s recovery came after a sharp fall Tuesday following comments from the US president-elect in an interview that it was too strong and that a weak Chinese yuan was ""killing us,"" fueling concerns of a possible currency war.The Dollar Index, which measures the dollar´s value against basket of peers, stood at 101.230, up sharply from 100.330 on Tuesday.In Asia, Hong Kong rallied 1.1 percent, boosted by a flood of mainland Chinese investors picking up stocks considered cheap compared with those north of the border, while a pick-up in the yuan eased fears about the mainland economy.Oil slipped after OPEC reported that its output inched lower in December but not by as much as the cartel promised in a landmark production cut deal reached the previous month.",2017-01-19

But the Iraqi government has criticized Trump for targeting the country in the ban, and parliament urged the government to retaliate against Americans entering the country if Washington refuses reconsider.GM, which Trump has criticized for building cars in Mexico, sent a statement to all employees on Sunday saying a few are from countries affected by the order, and pledging to provide support to any worker who encounters difficulty while traveling.Stressing that it welcomes individuals of all races, nationality, gender, culture or sexual orientation, GM said, ""Empowering these unique perspectives keeps GM on the cutting edge of technological innovation in the fast-paced automotive industry.""And Ford, which also has sparred with Trump over its Mexican operations, criticized the immigration policy, saying the company is ""proud of the rich diversity"" of workers.""That is why we do not support this policy or any other that goes against our values as a company.""The US Chamber of Commerce said the policy is creating confusion for companies with employees who are legal residents or dual nationals.",2017-01-31
1600,Uber CEO quits Trumps business advisory grou,"strong>SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON: Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick quit President Donald Trump's business advisory group on Thursday amid mounting pressure from activists and employees who oppose the administration's immigration policies.</strongCritics included Uber drivers, many of whom are immigrants themselves.""Joining the group was not meant to be an endorsement of the president or his agenda but unfortunately it has been misinterpreted to be exactly that,"" Kalanick, who had planned to attend a meeting of the group on Friday, said in an email to staff that was seen by Reuters.Uber spokeswoman Chelsea Kohler later confirmed that he had left the group.Social media campaigns had targeted Uber, urging users to delete accounts and opt for rival Lyft Inc. Uber has been emailing users who deleted their accounts to say it shares their concerns and will compensate drivers affected by the ban.Kalanick said he spoke briefly to Trump about the immigration order ""and its issues for our community"" and told the president he would not join the economic council.The CEO came under increasing pressure to leave the council after Trump issued an executive order temporarily barring people from seven Muslim nations from entering the United States.""There are many ways we will continue to advocate for just change on immigration but staying on the council was going to get in the way of that. The executive order is hurting many people in communities all across America,"" he wrote in a note to employees. ""Families are being separated, people are stranded overseas and theres a growing fear the U.S. is no longer a place that welcomes immigrants.""The White House said in a statement Thursday evening that did not mention Uber that Trump ""understands the importance of an open dialogue with fellow business leaders to discuss how to best make our nation's economy stronger.""The move could put pressure on other CEOs expected to attend a meeting with Trump on Friday. General Motors Co said its chief executive would attend, while Walt Disney Co said earlier Thursday its chief executive would not attend because of a long-planned board meeting.Others expected to take part include the CEOs of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Blackstone Group LP, IBM Corp and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Others that are part of the council include Tesla Inc CEO Elon Musk, PepsiCo Inc CEO Indra Nooyi and Boston Consulting Group CEO Rich Lesser.Musk said he would attend the meeting. ""In tomorrow's meeting, I and others will express our objections to the recent executive order on immigration and offer suggestions for changes to the policy,"" he said in a tweet on Thursday.Kalanick's departure could signal a growing rift between technology companies and Washington.""There is a battle brewing between Trump and Silicon Valley,"" said Neeraj Agrawal, general partner at Battery Ventures. ""They (the Trump administration) clearly don't value the economic activity generated by tech.""Microsoft Corp on Thursday said it proposed a modification of Trump's travel limits.Technology companies including Microsoft, Google owner Alphabet Inc, Apple Inc and Amazon.com Inc have opposed Trumps order, arguing that they rely on workers from around the world.Amazon and Expedia Inc have filed court documents supporting a legal challenge to the order by the Washington state attorney general.",2017-02-03
1601,Iran US sanctions stop American oil firms proj,"strong>TEHRAN: Iran has imposed no restrictions on U.S. oil firms willing to participate in energy projects in the country but American sanctions make such cooperation impossible, Iran's deputy oil minister said on Monday.</strong""Iran has not imposed any restrictions on the U.S. companies, but they cannot participate in our (oil and gas) tenders due to the U.S. laws,"" Amir Hossein Zamaninia, deputy oil minister for trade and international affairs, was quoted as saying by state news agency IRNA.""Based on the U.S. Congress sanctions, the American oil companies cannot work in Iran,"" he added.Iran said on Saturday that it will hold the country's first tender in mid-February since the lifting of international sanctions to develop oil and natural gas fields.OPEC's No. 3 oil producer hopes to draw foreign companies to invest in Iran and boost output after years of under-investment. However, foreign firms have so far made little inroads into the country despite the lifting of sanctions.President Donald Trump's new U.S. administration on Friday imposed fresh sanctions on Iran, which it said were just initial steps. It said Washington would no longer turn a ""blind eye"" to Iran's hostile actions.Dismissing the new sanctions, Zamaninia said ""such actions have had no effect, and international companies are still keen to do business with Iran.""Anglo-Dutch oil firm Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) signed a provisional deal in December to develop Iranian oil and gas fields South Azadegan, Yadavaran and Kish.",2017-02-06
1602,Sales of Ivanka Trump apparel slumped at Nordstrom WSJ repor,"WASHINGTON: Nordstrom´s sales of Ivanka Trump´s line of clothing and shoes fell by nearly one-third in the past fiscal year, with sharp drops in sales weeks before her father Donald Trump was elected president, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday.Nordstrom announced this week it had decided to stop carrying Ivanka Trump´s apparel, prompting President Trump to take to Twitter to defend her.""My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom,"" he said on Wednesday. The Journal cited internal Nordstrom data as showing sales of Ivanka Trump´s products were more than 70 percent lower in the second, third and fourth week of October compared to the same weeks the previous year.The election was on Nov.8. Nordstrom had $14.3 million in sales in the fiscal year that ended in January, down from $20.9 million in the previous year, the Journal reported.Nordstrom spokeswoman Tara Darrow said that the retailer did not provide the Wall Street Journal with data on Ivanka Trump´s sales.""We have not and will not share specific sales results numbers related to this brand or any other brand,"" Darrow said in an email.In addition to the president, others in the administration expressed support for Ivanka Trump´s business. Senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway was accused of violating ethics rules after she went on television to urge people to buy Ivanka Trump´s products in what she called ""a free commercial.""Republican Jason Chaffetz, chairman of the House of Representatives Oversight committee, said on Thursday he had asked the Office of Government Ethics to review Conway´s comments and recommend disciplinary action against her if warranted.",2017-02-12
1603,Ivanka Trump takes center stage at Trudeau meeting,"WASHINGTON: Donald Trump´s daughter Ivanka got a plum spot at America´s highest table Monday, attending her father´s meeting with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and businesswomen from both countries.Ivanka sat next to the 45-year-old Canadian premier in the White House Cabinet Room, and opened the discussion after both leaders had spoken.The appearance comes amid questions over the separation of Trump family businesses from the official roles of the president and his relatives.Trump is the first president in modern times to refuse to release his tax returns or divest from his business interests -- choosing instead to put his sons in charge.His daughter also has significant business interests that have become the focus for government ethics watchdogs.Trump last week tweeted that Ivanka had been ""treated so unfairly"" by Nordstrom, an upscale department store chain that dropped her fashion brand.And a key Trump aide is facing possible investigation after pitching the president´s daughter´s fashion brand on television.Speaking with the White House seal clearly visible over her shoulder, Kellyanne Conway gave Ivanka Trump´s clothing a rave review during a Fox interview, urging shoppers to ""go buy Ivanka´s stuff.""",2017-02-13
1604,Oil pares gains as US supply concerns overshadow OPEC cu,"strong>NEW YORK: Oil pared gains on Tuesday as concerns about rising supply from U.S. shale output overshadowed an OPEC-led effort to cut global output, which has supported oil prices in a higher range.</strongBrent crude was 61 cents higher at $56.20 a barrel by 11:30 Eastern (1530 GMT), after earlier rising to $56.46 a barrel. U.S. light crude was up 45 cents at $53.38.The two benchmarks fell 2 percent on Monday. They are both now near the middle of $5-per-barrel trading ranges seen since early December.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporters including Russia have agreed to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017 in a bid to rein in a global fuel supply overhang.The market has largely priced in the production cuts that OPEC and other producers agreed to in November, leaving little room for prices to break out of the range, said Tariq Zahir, managing member of Tyche Capital in New York.""It would take either a supply outage or serious cuts to move it,"" he said. ""The first month, obviously, OPEC is going to do the best it can, but after that, let's see what the second and third month bring.""Rising production in the United States, where increased drilling activity especially by shale oil producers, has undermined these efforts. U.S. crude output is up 6.5 percent since mid-2016 to 8.98 million bpd, its highest level since April last year.U.S. shale oil production for March is expected to rise by the most in five months to 4.87 million bpd, its highest rate of since May last year, government data showed on Monday.""Oil just appears to be caught in a range at the moment and mainly focused on those supply considerations,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.Although OPEC countries are largely sticking to their agreement with compliance around 90 percent, investors suspect the cuts may not be maintained, preventing them from having a bigger impact on prices.""OPEC producers want the market to believe they will stick to the agreed production freeze (cut). But lessons from the past have made the market deeply suspicious,"" said Hans van Cleef, senior energy economist at ABN AMRO Bank in Amsterdam.Many analysts say oil producers will have to cut production more quickly to drain the global oversupply this year.""Based on OPECs own numbers the message is loud and clear,"" said Tamas Varga, analyst at London broker PVM Oil Associates.""Improve on compliance, cut production further and extend the deal for the second half of the year if you want to avoid yet another year of global oil inventory builds.""",2017-02-14
1605,IMF sanctions Iran dampening economic senti,"strong>WASHINGTON: Uncertainty surrounding the sanctions on Iran and its relations with the United States pose a risk to the oil-producing nation´s economy, the International Monetary Fund said Monday.</strongThe comments were a reference to the new sanctions the Trump administration imposed early this month on individuals and companies supporting Iran´s ballistic missile program and the Revolutionary Guards military force.The measures came after Iran test-fired a medium range missile, which the White House contends violated a UN Security Council resolution proscribing missiles that could carry a nuclear device.Washington issued a tough warning that the United States and its allies had been ""too tolerant of Iran´s bad behavior"" under the 2015 six-nation agreement to monitor and contain the country´s nuclear weapons development.""The Trump Administration will no longer tolerate Iran´s provocations that threaten our interests,"" former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn said early this month, before being forced to resign his post.""The days of turning a blind eye to Iran´s hostile and belligerent actions toward the United States and the world community are over.""The IMF´s annual report on Iran´s economy, known as the Article IV review, said ""renewed uncertainty regarding sanctions is dampening sentiment.""The IMF staff said in their assessment the country benefited from higher oil production and is expected to grow 6.6 percent in 2016/2017, before easing to 3.3 percent in the next year.However, the uncertainty surrounding the nuclear agreement ""and especially relations with the US, could deter investment and trade with Iran and short-circuit the anticipated recovery,"" the report cautioned. ""If the agreement is derailed, the economy could risk recession.""Reimposing sanctions ""would lower direct investment and capital inflows, and disconnect Iran from the global financial system.""Jafar Mojarrad, IMF executive director for Iran, noted that, ""Regrettably, remaining US sanctions and related uncertainty have hindered the return of global banks to the Iranian market and continue to hamper large-scale investment and trade.""",2017-02-28
