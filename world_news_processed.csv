3314,pakistan fuel crisis weighing on credit worthiness moody,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan's ongoing fuel shortage that has led to worsening power blackouts is weighing on its credit worthiness and hindering its ability to meet key reform targets laid out by the IMF, ratings agency Moody´s warned Monday. The country is currently in the grip of one of its worst power crises in years due to a shortfall in imported oil, with the situation exacerbated Sunday by an attack on a key powerline in restive Balochistan province. Moody´s said that increasing energy imports without addressing structural issues that create so-called circular debt ""will further strain Pakistan's budget and balance of payments, a credit negative"". ""Fuel shortages also reflect the strained finances of state-owned distribution companies and the fuel importer, Pakistan State Oil corporation, and are a setback to the sector's progress on reforms made so far under Pakistan's financial support program with the International Monetary Fund.""The IMF granted a $6.6-billion loan to Pakistan in September 2013 on the condition that it carry out extensive economic reforms, particularly in the energy and taxation sectors.Moody´s, which in July 2014 upgraded Pakistan's rating outlook from ""negative"" to ""stable"" in a boon for the shaky South Asian economy, said that structural reforms had been a ""key driver"" in its decision last year. ""Circular debt"" -- brought on by the dual effect of the government setting low electricity prices and customers failing to pay -- is at the heart of the crisis. State utilities lose money, and cannot pay private power generating companies, which in turn cannot pay the oil and gas suppliers, who cut off the supply. The fuel crisis began last week when Pakistan State Oil was forced to slash imports because banks refused to extend any more credit to the government-owned company, which supplies 80 percent of the country´s oil. The shortfall led to long queues of angry motorists at petrol stations, though these have since dissipated as fuel supplies have reached the pumps. But Moody´s warned that the government of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, which made solving the energy crisis a key campaign pledge, had so far failed to offer policy solutions and increasing oil supplies would only add to the fiscal burden. ""The government´s targeted fiscal deficit of 4.5 percent of GDP in fiscal 2015 from 4.7 percent in fiscal 2014 is already impeded by delays in implementing electricity tariff adjustments and legal challenges related to tax collections,"" it said. Increasing fuel imports, which currently comprise 35 percent of total imports would further weigh on Pakistan´s import bill, it added.

3316,sbp warns islamic banks to be more equitab,"KARACHI: State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) governor on Thursday urged the country´s Islamic banks to develop ways to reward their customers in line with a surge in the sector´s profitability, or face regulatory action. Islamic finance is experiencing a revival in Pakistan, aided by an ambitious five-year plan that regulators hope will double the industry´s share of the banking sector to 20 percent by 2020.A growing client base and improving asset quality helped Islamic banks post profits before tax of 12 billion rupees ($119.1 million) in the third quarter of last year, almost double the year-earlier amount, central bank data shows. But regulators want to tackle consumer perceptions that Islamic banks falter when it comes to social responsibility and ethical banking practices.The average financing-to-deposit spread - the difference between what banks charge for financing and what they pay their depositors - for all lenders, Islamic and conventional, remains high and should be ""reasonably rationalised"", central bank governor Ashraf Wathra said in a speech to a gathering of industry executives on Monday. He did not specify a satisfactory level, but singled out Islamic banks as the ones needing to reward customers in line with a rise in profits.""Banks were advised to come up with their own solutions or the SBP will apply sharia-compliant measures to address the issue,"" said Wathra. He did not elaborate, but in the past the central bank has prescribed minimum targets for banks to lend to specific sectors of the economy such as agriculture and small business. Islamic banks follow religious principles which ban the charging of interest and gambling, and stress the sharing of risk and profits. The industry has developed a range of sharia-compliant financial tools, some with greater profit-sharing qualities than others. Islamic banks fall short when it comes to using strongly profit-sharing instruments such as musharaka, whose share of overall Islamic financing in Pakistan was only 10.1 percent as of September, compared to 4.2 percent a year earlier. Musharaka is a partnership in which two or more parties agree to provide capital, sharing both profits and losses according to a stipulated ratio. By contrast, murabaha - a cost-plus-profit arrangement where one party agrees to buy merchandise for another - commands the lion´s share of financing by the country´s Islamic banks, at 30.3 percent. Murabaha is often criticised for lacking economic substance and its resemblance to a conventional loan.

The Baker Hughes North America rig count report for the week to January 30 showed a drop of 128 rigs to 1,937. That compared with 2,393 a year ago.Some analysts however remain doubtful that the current oil price rebound will be sustained as supplies still outweigh demand in the immediate term.The oil market has lost more than half its value since June largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale oil production. The problem was exacerbated in November after OPEC decided to maintain output levels despite plunging prices.The 12-nation Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) cartel pumps about 30 percent of global crude supplies.

He added that the industries were facing four hours of load shedding.However, PPPs Fahmida Mirza contradicted the ministers figures saying that he is wrong about his statistics and that Badin was facing 20 to 22 hours of load shedding.

Crude prices on Wednesday snapped a three-day rally, with WTI sinking 8.7 percent owing to climbing US crude stockpiles.Analysts said prices are weighed down also by the euro´s fall on news that the European Central Bank had cut off Greek banks´ access to a key source of much-needed cash.In a decision that rattled global financial markets, the ECB said Wednesday it would no longer allow Greek banks to use government debt, which has a junk rating, as collateral for loans.""The Greek situation is worth keeping an eye on as it massively impacts the value of the euro against the US dollar,"" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.A sinking euro makes dollar-priced oil more expensive, denting demand and adding downward pressure on crude prices, which have already been battered by a supply glut and weak demand.Crude has lost more than half its value since June, when prices were at more than $100 a barrel.Global supplies have been boosted by surging US shale oil production and a decision by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries in November to keep current output levels.

""Upon completion of the review, SDR 360 million (about US$518 million) would be made available to Pakistan, said the outgoing chief of the IMF Mission to Pakistan Jeffery Franks.Newly-announced Chief of IMF Mission to Pakistan, Herald Finger, will replace Franks after the talks.At a jointly held press conference with the IMF staff in Dubai, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar reiterated that there would be no increase in gas and electricity prices. Pakistan also informed the IMF of its expenditure of Rs. 150 billion on the implementation of the National Action Plan (NAP) as well as repatriation of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs).Also agreed upon was Rs.60 billion in tax cuts for Pakistan, while it was decided that the target for tax cuts should reach Rs. 2750 million by June.Dar said that Pakistans foreign exchange reserves have increased to over $15 billion, entitling the country to receive subsidised loans.However, due to the price reduction of petrol in the country, tax revenue decreased to Rs. 68 billion. Tax revenues were below the second-quarter indicative target by about 0.1 percent of GDP due in part to legal challenges to some revenue measures and to the fiscal effects of the plunge in international oil prices, said a press statement from the IMF mission. While progress has been made in addressing the structural impediments to higher and more inclusive growth, important challenges remain, such as steps to enhance the independence of the SBP, permanently resolve energy sector deficiencies, complete the legal framework for deposit insurance, and privatize or restructure public enterprises, noted the IMF.

He also said that the matter of the ministry not supplying the requirement is sub judice and could lead to contempt of court. Meanwhile, Karachi Chamber of Commerce & Industry President Iftikhar Ahmed Vohra said that if the national grid fails to provide the required demand, industrial production may be heavily affected.He demanded from the government that it should reconsider the supply of 650MW and include it in the contract.On January 26, the ministry had directed the National Power Control Centre (NPCC) not to suspend electricity supply to K-Electric following the expiry of the power distributors 5-year agreement for 650 MW supply on January 25.

US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in March advanced $1 to $52.69 a barrel compared with Friday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for March won 63 cents to stand at $58.43 a barrel in London afternoon trade.Last week saw WTI surge seven percent and Brent add 9.4 percent, their best weekly gains since February 2011.Nicholas Teo, market analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, said the gains were ""motivated by supply-side influences"" in the United States.A survey by US oil services firm Baker Hughes Inc released Friday showed the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States fell by 83 to 1,140 in the week to February 6. The dip followed a cut of 94 rigs the previous week.Bloomberg News reported that the rig count was standing at its lowest level since December 2011.The drop, coupled with announcements of deep cuts in capital spending by major oil companies including BP and BG Group, suggests tighter supplies in the future.Oil prices have plunged by about 50 percent from their June peaks, largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production.Teo said a surprisingly robust jobs report in the United States was also supporting prices as it heralds stronger demand.The Labor Department on Friday reported that the world´s biggest economy added 257,000 jobs in January and revised upward already healthy growth in the previous two months.The unemployment rate edged up to 5.7 percent from 5.6 percent, but that was in part because more people were actively seeking jobs.

Citing a major shakeup in the oil markets, the IEA said in its five-year forecast that prices will recover from current levels of around $50-60 per barrel but remain considerably below the more than $100 price tags reached the slump began in June.""The global oil market looks set to begin a new chapter of its history, with markedly changing demand dynamics, sweeping shifts in crude trade and product supply, and dramatically different roles for OPEC and non-OPEC producers in regulating upstream supply,"" the IEA said.It added that it sees market rebalancing occurring ""relatively swiftly"", with increases in inventories halting mid-year and the market tightening.""This morning´s slight dip is likely due to the IEA report that predicts only a slow recovery for oil prices. However this is only in the short term as the market fundamentals have not changed,"" said Shailaja Nair, associate editorial director at energy information provider Platts.Prices have plunged from their mid-2014 peaks largely owing to a surge in global reserves boosted by robust US shale production and weak global demand.

3341,oil prices extend slid,"London: Oil prices slid Monday, extending last week´s sharp decline as the dollar strengthens on eurozone strains and record supplies in the United States add further downward pressure.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in April shed $1.17 to $49.64 a barrel compared with Friday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for April lost $1.24 to stand at $58.98 in London afternoon deals.WTI slumped 4.66 percent and Brent tumbled 2.1 percent during the week to last Friday.""Crude oil prices extended declines (Monday)... as investors remained cautious following the ongoing uncertainty in the eurozone, while the strong US dollar currently weighed on market sentiment,"" said Myrto Sokou, senior research analyst at Sucden brokers.""Crude oil inventories continue to remain fairly high, following sharp builds of crude oil stocks in the last few weeks. The continuous large increases of crude inventories verify a possible slowdown of US oil demand,"" she added.Globally, crude supplies are being boosted after oil fields in eastern Libya resumed pumping to the Hariga port after a pipeline was repaired, Bloomberg News reported.And Oman, the biggest Middle East producer outside the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, plans to ramp up output to 980,000 barrels a day this year.Crude prices lost around 60 percent of their value between June and late January owing to an oversupply in world markets, a weak global economy and a strong dollar that made oil expensive to purchase for holders of rival currencies.The euro continued to be pressured by the dollar Monday despite eurozone ministers tentatively agreeing to extend Greece´s bailout by four months.While oil prices have won support in recent weeks on a decline in operating US oil rigs and as energy giants cut investment, markets-watchers say volatility is likely to continue for some time.Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said a sustained rebound for oil prices was unlikely because of a global oversupply of the commodity, noting that US crude production has remained strong at above 9.2 million barrels per day.He said a strike in US oil refineries has led to an excess of crude in the American market as less of the product is being sent to the facilities for refining.Workers at three major US oil refineries operated with Royal Dutch Shell went on strike on Saturday in a dispute over safer working conditions, the United Steelworkers (USW) union said.About 1,350 employees in three refineries and chemical plants are affected by the latest strike action, which mirrored walkouts on other sites launched earlier this month.

3344,tajikistan to help pakistan overcome energy crisis through kasa 1000 proj,"ISLAMABAD: Ambassador of Tajikistan Sher Ali Jononov on Friday said that his country was preparing to export sizeable quantity of electricity to Pakistan to lessen the intensity of the energy crisis which has compromised economic growth. The KASA 1000 project is among the major electricity transfer projects in the region, based on which 1,300 megawatts of electricity from Kazakhstan and Tajikistan is expected to be transferred to Afghanistan and Pakistan.He said that Tajikistan wished to enhance bilateral trade with Pakistan and invited the business community to visit his country to explore investment opportunities and organise trade exhibitions. He added that the energy sector of Tajikistan had been showing sustainable growth for the last 15 years transforming the country into the worlds third largest producer of hydroelectric power after the US and Russia. Jononov went on to say that hydroelectric generation accounted for 76 percent of the total energy output of the country and the total cost of the project which would lighten Pakistan through Tajik electricity will be financed by the World Bank, ADB, Islamic Development Bank and other donors.He also said that this project would not only alleviate electricity shortages in Pakistan but would also replace fuel based electricity generation for Afghanistan and Pakistan, adding that it would also establish Afghanistan as a viable transit country and offer transmission capacity for other countries during the off peak season.He further said that it would also create a viable governance mechanism to build confidence among neighbours as major share of the export will be used by Pakistan and approximately 300 MW will be utilised by Afghanistan.

3350,dollar at 12 year peak vs euro emerging markets spooked,"LONDON: The US dollar hit multi-year highs against the euro and yen on Tuesday on the growing chance of the Federal Reserve hiking interest rates by mid-year, the prospect of which also hurt stocks and currencies from emerging markets.The skittish mood spread from Asia to Europe where stocks were down for a second day despite the European Central Bank's new bond buying campaign continuing to push down the euro and the bloc's already record-low borrowing costs.Driving the dollar up was speculation that the Federal Reserve, in contrast, will start lifting interest rates from mid-year after another round of stellar jobs data on Friday and a subsequent chorus of hawkish Fed policymaker comments.The euro's woes were compounded by worries about Greece as euro zone finance ministers met in Brussels a day after the head of the group, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, urged Athens to ""stop wasting time"" and start implementing reforms.Selling in the euro had gathered pace again in Europe as a break below a major layer of chart support at $1.0762 to $1.0735 left bears eyeing 1.07 the figure and some mulling potential parity.The dollar also broke higher on the yen in Asia to reach 122.02, territory not visited since July 2007.""It is all about the Fed now,"" said Aurelija Augulyte senior FX strategist at Nordea in Helsinki. ""The ECB (bond buying) bias has now been fully digested, but what the market is now trying to do is price in earlier Fed rate hikes.""The prospect of rising US yields threatened to draw funds away from emerging markets, causing strains from Brazil to Turkey. The Brazilian real led the rout, having fallen for the sixth straight session.The pressure spread then through Asia with the South Korean won hitting its lowest since late August 2013 and the Singapore dollar its lowest since 2010.Eastern Europe was also heavily in the red. Selling accelerated for Poland's zloty, Romania's leu and Hungary's forint and MSCI's main emerging market stock index fell 1 percent, down for its eighth day running.

Quite to the contrary, it continues to defy expectations,"" said the IEA in its monthly report, which sharply revised up output estimates for the end of last year and forecasts for the start of 2015.The IEA hiked its demand forecasts for every quarter this year, with the annual 2015 figure bumped up by 100,000 barrels per day to 93.5 mbpd, compared with its previous forecast given last month.In earlier Asian trading, the oil market had risen on news of a deal to end a strike at US refineries.Crude futures had fallen Thursday after a government report showed surging US stockpiles, adding to a global oversupply.The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said inventories hit a fresh record high of 448.9 million barrels last week, while stockpiles at the Cushing terminal hub in Oklahoma -- the price settlement point for WTI -- also increased.Bloomberg News meanwhile reported the United Steelworkers union representing 30,000 US oil workers had reached a tentative deal on a four-year contract with Royal Dutch Shell that could see a mass walkout brought to a close.Another development affecting the market was an announcement on Monday by the US Energy Information Administration raising its crude production forecast this year to 9.35 million barrels per day from 9.30 million.

U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) was down 84 cents at $48.03 a barrel.Barclays said that the U.S. build-up in stocks would make its way into an already oversupplied market in the second quarter and that global demand would unlikely be strong enough to support oil prices once that happens.""In OECD Asia, demand growth actually fell from -3 percent to -4 percent (in Q1) ...

More Iranian oil could enter global markets if that is followed by a comprehensive deal by June.But analysts warned a ramp-up in exports could take months and would likely not happen before 2016.""While clearly a bearish headline, a final deal and full lifting of sanctions still faces a number of obstacles,"" Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note.""Even if a final deal is reached, we do not expect any physical market impact before 2016,"" the analysts said.Brent crude for May delivery touched a high of $56.19 a barrel and was up $1.19 from Thursday at $56.14 by 0635 GMT. US crude for May delivery was $1.21 higher at $50.35 a barrel, after earlier touching $50.48.There was no settlement in either Brent or US crude futures on Friday as markets were closed for the start of the Easter holiday.Despite the sanctions on Iran, China's imports from the OPEC producer are set to rise from August as a Chinese state trader has signed a deal with the National Iranian Oil Company to buy more condensate.The world's top exporter Saudi Arabia kept output steady and cut its official selling prices (OSPs) sharply late last year in a fight for market share during a global supply glut.Its ability to raise prices for April and May suggests its strategy is working, although competition has kept its flagship Arab Light at a discount to Oman/Dubai quotes, analysts said.""There is still competition for the Asia market even though it is also a sign that some of the production elsewhere is less able to compete in the market right now,"" said Shunling Yap, a senior oil and gas analyst at BMI Research.On the supply front, the number of rigs drilling for oil in the United States declined by 11 last week to 802, the smallest drop since December, a weekly survey by oil service firm Baker Hughes showed on Thursday.Two weeks of small declines in the US rig count have raised expectations that drilling activity is nearing a level that could dent output, bolster prices and coax rigs back to the field after a precipitous cull since October.

3382,lending to private sector falls 36pc in july apri,"KARACHI: Lending to private sector contracted by 36.5 percent during the first nine months of the current fiscal year of 2014/15, despite the central banks efforts to get credit flowing through thrice cut in policy rates, data showed on Tuesday.Analyst said banks hefty invested into the government papers and low borrowing costs have made little success in investment and spending by the businesses and consumers.The flow of loans to different firms fell to Rs178.9 billion between July 1, 2014 and April 3, 2015 against Rs281.9 billion during the same period of last fiscal year, the central bank said.Analysts said that bank heavy investment in the government treasury reduced the supply of lendable funds for the private sector despite falling borrowing costs.Since the start of 2014, banks have been actively placing funds in long-term Pakistan Investment Bonds, which carry much higher returns than the weighted average lending rate banks get from the industrial sector.And the central bank also continued to pump liquidity into the banking system to meet the shortage in the market because of banks higher investment in the government papers.The State Bank of Pakistan injected a record high Rs842 billion into the banking system on March 20, through the opening market operations.Tuesdays data on monetary aggregates depicted that the government borrowing from commercial banks reached at high level of Rs1.230 trillion from a same period a year ago.The governments rising demand for bank borrowing has pushed out the private sector from banking.According to report from a brokerage house, investment to deposit ratio (IDR) of banks increased to 61.2pc in 2014 as compared to 54.1pc in the preceding year. Investment in government securities touched new peak as such a high IDR level has never been achieved previously.Though yields on the government papers are falling (7pc on T-bills and 8-9pc on PIBs), an anticipation of further cut in discount rate pushes banks to lock-in funds in PIBs on high returns.Since November 2014, the cumulative discount rate has been reduced by 200 basis points following low inflation and positive outlook on external sector.The government is not firmly agreed with the analysts view that banks are not interested in extending private sector loans and parking their whole money into the government papers.The government in its latest letter of intent to the IMF said, Private sector credit continued its healthy expansion (10.2 percent so far in FY15) driven mainly by businesses, and in particular manufacturing.Some analysts foresee bank lending to start expanding in coming quarters. Within different financing segments, a moderate pickup is expected in consumer loans.The State Bank, with the help of World Bank experts, has developed a comprehensive National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to implement financial sector reforms to meet their financing needs. The central bank is likely to launch the NFIS by end-April 2015.In order to improve the credit information system to help banks extend credit to broader sections of society, the Credit Bureau Act was submitted to parliament in February 2014 and the government expects it to be enacted by November 2015 to ensure that credit information sharing will protect the privacy rights of individuals.Private investment and growth are hampered by impediments in the legal framework for creditors rights and contract enforcement, barriers to new business start-ups, complex legal, taxation and border trade requirements, and impaired access to finance.

3383,china offering pakistan huge financing chinese assistant foreign minister,"BEIJING: Pakistan needs a huge amount of financing for infrastructure and energy projects and China is ready to announce help when President Xi Jinping visits next week, a foreign ministry official said Friday.Islamabad has for decades been Beijing´s closest ally in South Asia, and China -- which is expanding its influence in the region -- is a major trading partner and key supplier of military technology to Pakistan.Chinese assistant foreign minister Liu Jianchao declined to offer details in a briefing to reporters ahead of Xi´s two-day trip, which starts Monday, saying that the ""specific figure"" would be announced during the visit.But he said a ""huge amount of financing"" was needed for projects in the transport, infrastructure and energy fields that are part of a China-Pakistan economic corridor initiative.""China stands ready to provide financial support for Pakistan to be used on these projects,"" Liu said.The Wall Street Journal reported that Xi would announce a $46 billion spending plan for infrastructure, with the largest share going for electricity generation.Xi was originally scheduled to visit last September but Beijing cancelled the trip with Islamabad in the grip of major anti-government street protests.China has been a key financial and military ally of Islamabad over the years and Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif secured promises of $42 billion worth of investment when he went to Beijing in November last year.Much of that centred on the energy sector -- Pakistan has wrestled with chronic power shortages in recent years that have scrubbed several points off GDP growth and inflicted misery on the everyday lives of its citizens.Pakistan´s foreign ministry said Thursday that a number of important agreements and memorandums of understanding would be signed during the visit, but gave no details.Liu said Xi´s visit would be the first by a Chinese president in nine years and stressed that it was his first overseas trip this year.""It is yet another major diplomatic action taken by China´s top leader in China´s neighbourhood,"" he said.He added that the trip will ""map out an overall plan for China-Pakistan relations and cooperation in various areas for the next five to 10 years and take bilateral relations to a new level.""

3393,hopes and fears as milan expo opens door,"MILAN: Milans Expo 2015 opened on Friday with hopes the six-month food-themed world fair will be a catalyst for economic revival competing with fears it will simply underline Italys deep-seated problems.The first global exhibition since Shanghai´s groundbreaking hosting five years ago has been beset by delays and the site was far from fully completed as the first visitors streamed in at 0800 GMT.Corruption scandals, fears of violent protests and evidence of a fledgling economic recovery running out of steam have all dampened the mood in the run-up to the event.But Italy is a master at delivering at the 11th hour -- the finishing touches to some of the stadiums for the 1990 World Cup came within minutes of kick-off.And a spectacular eve-of-opening concert, featuring tenor Andrea Bocelli, Chinese pianist Lang Lang and the choir and opera of the city´s renowned La Scala opera house performing in front of Milan´s magnificent Gothic cathedral, was a reminder of the country´s capacity to compensate with creativity for its shortcomings in the more humdrum aspects of event planning.Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has been bullishly predicting that it will all be alright on the night, facing down the opponents who say a state with Italy´s unsustainable debt should not be ploughing money into an event that is, by definition, ephemeral in nature.Those opponents are due to stage a major march on Friday and fears of a spillover into violence were raised by incidents on the eve of the opening, when a few dozen masked protestors attempted to spray-paint and smash the windows of a branch of Manpower, an employment agency that is one of the official partners of the Expo.- Milan seeking reinvention -Italy secured the rights to host the Expo seven years ago, long before Renzi came to power last year. But he has embraced it as an opportunity for Italy to show the world that it is reinventing itself under his leadership.The event plays to Italy´s strengths with its nutrition and gastronomy-based theme of ""Feeding the Planet, Energy for Life.""Organisers are predicting 20 million visitors over six months and a 10-billion-euro boost to economic activity through increased tourist revenues and other, harder to measure, benefits such as increased investment.More than a million Chinese are expected to visit Milan for the Expo and Italian officials are hoping some of them will become long-term business partners as the economic relationship between the two countries flourishes.For Milan, the Expo is also about reinvention with the city seeking to forge a new image as a 21st Century ""smart"" city that is defined as much by its flair for gastronomy, design and sustainable living as by its industrial past.There will be tight airport-style security around the site and a huge police presence on Friday in anticipation of the ""No Expo"" movement´s march.Earlier this week, police carried out pre-emptive raids on radical groups suspected of planning to ensure the demonstration turns into a showdown with the security forces.Officers seized fireworks, baseball bats, gas masks and material which could be used to make Molotov cocktails.The organisers of Friday´s demonstration have insisted it will be peaceful and accuse the police and media of whipping up public alarm because they are fearful that there will be more people protesting than visiting the Expo.The Expo´s critics have focused on the conditions of some of the 6,000 employees who have been engaged on a work experience basis, as well as the involvement of corporations such as McDonalds and Coca Cola, saying that has stripped the event of any environmental credibility.

3395,gulf oil exporters should cut spending diversify imf,"DUBAI: Gulf oil exporters must reduce spending, including subsidies, and diversify their economies to cope with lower revenues caused by the sharp drop in crude prices, the International Monetary Fund said.The wealthy monarchies, however, should ""not react in a knee-jerk way to lower oil prices"", the IMF Middle East and Central Asia chief Masood Ahmed told AFP in an interview Monday.They would be better off to ""adjust gradually"" using the large financial reserves they have accumulated during several years of bumper oil receipts, he said in Dubai. But as oil prices have dropped lower than budgeted breakeven levels, ""it is important that they gradually, but in a determined way... reduce their spending (and) consolidate their fiscal position,"" Ahmed said.Oil prices have shed half of their value since June 2014, and are expected to be lower than the breakeven point for Gulf countries in the next three to four years.The Gulf Cooperation Council includes Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- economies all heavily dependent on energy revenues. A combined budget surplus for 2014 of $76 billion (68.5 billion euros) is expected to turn into a deficit of $113 billion this year, the IMF said in its latest regional report. ""They need to act to reinforce their efforts to diversify their economies to become less dependent on oil,"" said Ahmed, pointing out that many have already taken such measures.""The UAE is more advanced in terms of diversification. The others also are in varying degrees trying to encourage private sector activity outside the oil area."" - Curb subsidies -GCC countries were also urged to cut energy subsidies in a bid to minimise public spending and trigger a change in consumer behaviour.""Most GCC countries still have the domestic sale price for energy products below the international prices... We think that over time it is important to tackle the issue of energy subsidies to reduce them,"" Ahmed said.Gulf states should also contain salary growth in the public sector, which usually employs nationals as opposed to the private sector that depends on millions of foreigners.In addition, GCC countries would need to prioritise investment projects that ""most advance the development agenda,"" said Ahmed.Oil-export revenues for GCC countries are forecast to be $280 billion lower this year than a year ago.With the exception of gas-rich Qatar and Kuwait, all GCC states are expected to face budget deficits this year, said Ahmed, adding this could persist for two or three years.""The important thing to recognise is that GCC countries have built up financial buffers that put them in a very strong position to be able to use these savings to finance expenditure and to have a gradual decrease in spending over the coming years,"" he said.This in turn would minimise the economic impact of the drop in oil prices. GCC states are estimated to have foreign reserves of about $2.5 trillion.""The impact on (economic) growth is quite limited,"" said Ahmed.The IMF has forecast GCC countries to grow as a group at 3.4 percent in 2015, one percent down from earlier predictions, mainly because of a slowdown in non-oil growth in response to lower oil prices.

3402,adb to finance 6 billion in pakistan infrastructure proj,"KARACHI: The Asian Development Bank on Tuesday approved a $6 billion loan to help build up Pakistans dilapidated power network and other key infrastructure, Islamabad said.Among the projects to be financed by the ADB is a 660-megawatt coal-fired power plant in southern Pakistan, while funds will also be allocated for projects related to health, education and highway construction.""(The ADB) agreed to finance US$6 billion for the next five years in Pakistan,"" an economic affairs ministry statement said, adding that the funds would help Pakistan tackle a long-running electricity crisis.Along with the 660-megawatt plant, the funds will be used for several hydroelectric dams that will each generate between 100 and 300 megawatts.Pakistan is expected to see accelerating economic growth in the coming years, with the International Monetary Fund forecasting 4.1 per cent expansion this fiscal year, followed by 4.5 per cent growth next year.Ratings agency Standard and Poors meanwhile has upgraded the countrys credit rating outlook from stable to positive.But electricity provision continues to be a massive problem.Pakistan faces an annual power shortfall of around 4,000 megawatts in the peak summer months of June and July when temperatures can reach 50 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit) in the countrys centre.

Abdullah al-Attiyah, who led the energy portfolio in oil-rich Qatar for about two decades, said Monday that OPEC should first reach a binding agreement with non-members before reducing production.""OPEC should not do anything because it is not the swing producer"" of the past, Attiyah told reporters in Kuwait City.""They cannot and will not cut (output) unless the main producers outside OPEC join forces,"" he said.The 12-nation Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) in November maintained output levels despite tumbling prices. The group, led by de-facto kingpin Saudi Arabia, pumps about 30 percent of global crude.Nicholas Teo, analyst at CMC Markets in Singapore, added that concerns over a persistent global oversupply ""continue to put a cap on oil prices"". Those worries were compounded by the latest US data showing petroleum drilling is picking up in some areas. The closely watched Baker Hughes US oil rig count fell by just 11 to 668 last week.Dealers have been hoping that a slowdown in US shale output could help ease the build up of global crude reserves, which was a key reason for the collapse in prices of more than 50 percent between June and January. Overall crude reserves in the United States likely fell by 500,000 barrels in the week to May 8, according to a survey of analysts by Bloomberg News. The US Energy Department will release the official stockpiles figures on Wednesday. (AFP)

3407,china pm on brazil visit promising big inv,"BRASILIA: Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang headed to Brazil on Monday on a three-day visit with a promise of $50 billion in investment for creaking infrastructure as his hosts finalize preparations for next year´s Rio Olympics.Li, who was due to land late afternoon in the capital Brasilia, will hold talks Tuesday with President Dilma Rousseff, for whom the investment will be a major boon. Brazil´s economy is battling a fifth straight year of poor growth and spiraling inflation. Li will head for Rio on Tuesday evening to see some of China´s investment in the city, which Brasilia supplanted as the capital in 1960 but which will in August next year welcome South America´s first ever Olympic Games.On Thursday, Li will continue a Latin American swing designed to increase Chinese influence in the region, heading to Colombia before visiting Peru and Chile.Chinese investment in Brazil has grown exponentially over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil´s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole rose some 2,550 percent between 2000 and 2012 from barely $10 billion to $255.5 billion.Boom in Sino-Brazilian tradeSino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, said ahead of Li´s arrival that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is under way. The first involved trade in raw materials and the focus now is on heavy industry and infrastructure, he said.Graca Lima said Friday that Rousseff and Li will ink a series of accords on political and commercial issues, and some 30 investment deals. One mooted project is a proposed rail link stretching some 3,500 kilometers (2,175 miles) from the key Brazilian port of Santos to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.Graca Lima said the plan would take some three to four years to realize, but he assured it is ""advancing,"" despite some environmental groups voicing concern.The countries are also expected to announce the delivery of 22 jetliners from Brazil´s Embraer to China -- part of a larger order of 60 airplanes from the world´s number three commercial aircraft developer.Brazil has seen its reputation hit by a huge graft scandal at oil giant Petrobras. But the firm received a boost earlier this year when it signed a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.""China is fulfilling a desperately-needed role of investor in Latin America and the Caribbean -- Brazil desperately needs investment,"" says Charles Tang, chairman of the Rio-based Brazil-China Chamber of Commerce and Industry.""The US back yard is growing a Chinese back garden - not just in Brazil but all over Latin America.""""We believe in the fundamentals of Brazil,"" Tang told AFP.""China sees opportunities in Brazil for investment and also has the funds available to invest"" for strategic and geopolitical reasons.In an interview, Tang referred to a World Policy Institute essay he penned in 2013 in which he said ""Latin America and China´s economies are complementary. Brazil ... has insufficient savings to finance increases in export production and job creation or build the infrastructure it needs.""China has abundant capital -- but needs the plentiful strategic resources that Brazil has.""Li´s visit will feature trade delegations some 130-strong from both countries during his Brasilia stay. In Rio, he will attend the unveiling of Chinese-made trains for a new Metro line.

Saudi Arabia exported just shy of eight million barrels of crude oil per day in March -- the highest export volume in more than nine years,"" said analysts at Commerzbank in a note to clients on Tuesday.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets Singapore, said ""global oversupply with weak demand"" continues to put a cap on prices despite geopolitical unrest raising concerns about a disruption in the Middle East.He said the crude market is already ""used to"" unrest in the region, where Islamic State fighters on Sunday captured the key Iraqi city of Ramadi.Yemen is also engulfed in violence that analysts fear could escalate and draw in neighbouring Saudi Arabia and Iran, which are backing the warring factions.Yemen is not a major oil-producing country, but its coast forms one side of the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, the key strategic entry point into the Red Sea through which some 4.7 million barrels of oil pass each day on ships headed to or from the Suez Canal.""Fears that the fighting in Iraq and Yemen could hamper the oil supply have clearly given way to a more sober appraisal, for the past twelve months have demonstrated that such concerns are exaggerated,"" Commerzbank analysts added. ""In actual fact, the oil supply from the region has continued to grow.""Oil supplies from leading OPEC producers Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates are already near their highest levels in three decades, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said last week. Crude futures have fought back a little in recent weeks after prices plummeted more than 60 percent between June and January, as the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries refused to cut production despite a global glut.The move by the 12-nation OPEC cartel, which pumps about 30 percent of global crude, was widely taken as an attempt to push US shale producers, which have higher costs, out of the market.

3409,senate passes gas infrastructure development cess bill amid pr,"ISLAMABAD: Following its approval from National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, the upper house Senate on Wednesday also passed the Gas Infrastructure Development Cess (GIDC) bill 2015 amid protest from some opposition members.During the discussion, members of opposition parties criticized the government for presenting the bill in the house and urged that it should be presented in Council of Common Interest (CCI) for consultation with the provinces before its passage. Senator Tahir Hussain Mashhadi of MQM said that the the bill should have been presented in the CCI. He said any tax on natural resources cannot be imposed without consultation of provinces, he said.Senator Nauman Wazir and Sentor Saleem Mandviwala called for need to find a mechansim of gas infrastructure development and suggested that concerns of opposition should also be addressed.Opposition Leader Aitzaz Ahsan and Senators including Usman Saifullah, Mohsin Aziz, Shahi Syed, Saeed Ghani, Usman Kakar, Sassui Paleejo, Robina Adnan, Naseema Ehsan and Mohsin Leghari registered their opposing comments on the bill during discussion.Opposition members belonging to Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM), Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), Awami National Party (ANP) and Balochistan National Awami Party staged a token walk out from the House.Earlier, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi in his winding up speech said National Assembly has already passed the Bill and said the government requires Rs1000 billion annually to maintain and improve gas infrastructure in the country.He said that Rs100 billion would be collated annually through this levy and it would be used for gas infrastructure and added that no province is self-sufficient in gas.He said that the production of gas is 4 BCFD and demand is 8 BCFD adding that it is very necessary to fund some important projects.He said that TAPI is Rs1 trillion project but our share is of Rs100 billion.The minister said that the collection amount of GIDC would not be misused and the parliament would oversee it.Shahid Khaqan said that the CCI itself says that the GIDC does not come into its domain and federal government should settle it. He said that Supreme Court has already decided that it is not a tax but a cess.Defending further the Cess Bill, he argued that to bridge the widening gas supply gap a number of gas import projects were being perused including the Iran-Pakistan (IP) gas pipeline project, Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) pipeline project, LNG import projects and LPG supply enhancement project in public as well as private sectors.He said that in case the required infrastructure was not developed for the above mentioned projects the government would be forced to import liquefied fuels which are much costlier as compared to gas.Further Pakistan would also be exposed to payment of liquidated damages or payments. According to him presently neither the federal government nor any gas utility has adequate funding to implement the above project.To create the required infrastructure it was therefore necessary that a new Cess may be imposed.He also accepted the idea of some opposition Senators for forming a committee to point out anomalies in the bill, which would prepare its recommendations to make the bill more beneficial.The minister went on to say that it would be the current government, which has planned to provide gas to every district of Balochistan APP/Geo News

3411,china brazil unveil multibillion trade investment d,"BRASILIA: Chinese Premier Li Keqiang lifted the wraps Tuesday on a multibillion-dollar series of trade and investment deals with Brazil, as Beijing looks to invest $53 billion in South Americas largest economy.The news unveiled at the start of Li´s first official visit to Latin America is a huge boon for Brazil as it endures a fifth straight year of low growth after a period of rapid expansion fueled by Asian demand for commodities that has since slowed.Li´s host, President Dilma Rousseff, hopes Brazil can direct Chinese cash to overhaul decaying infrastructure as the country´s tourist magnet Rio de Janeiro prepares to host South America´s first ever Olympics next year.Headlining 35 deals on Li´s first official visit to Latin America were a pair of finance and cooperation agreements worth $7 billion for Brazil´s state-owned oil firm Petrobras.Rousseff, who will make a state visit next year to China, spoke of a ""new intensity in our relations.""""China and Brazil are playing a leading role in the construction of a new global order,"" she added.Rousseff, re-elected in October, has been battling a welter of negative economic data as well as fallout from a huge graft scandal at Petrobras.Li pointed to China´s ""rich experience"" in building infrastructure, saying Beijing ""would like to cooperate with Brazil in reducing its costs.""Despite a multibillion-dollar kickbacks scandal battering its reputation as Brazil´s flagship company, Petrobras had earlier this year received another Beijing boost in signing a $3.5 billion financing deal with the China Investment Bank.Despite becoming Brazil´s number one trading partner in 2009, amid an exponential rise in two-way trade, China currently ranks only 12th in terms of actual investment in Brazil, prompting Brasilia to seek deeper economic ties.The Chinese are notably supplying new metro trains and catamarans to Rio and Li will visit the Olympic host city Wednesday to inspect those investments before leaving Thursday for Colombia ahead of trips to Peru and Chile.Li´s tour, aimed at underpinning growing Chinese influence in Latin America, comes just days after Beijing signed accords worth $25 billion and $22 billion respectively with fellow BRICS developing nations Russia. But the Brazil package is worth more than those combined.- Air deals, railroad dreams -Aside from the Petrobras agreements, Rousseff and Li also signed a range of deals designed to further bilateral cooperation on trade, investment, agriculture, energy and transport.Brasilia and Beijing also finalised a $1.3 billion accord to sell 22 Brazilian Embraer commercial jets to China´s Tianjin Airlines, Embraer said.Brazil´s Vale, the world´s biggest iron producer, announced a range of deals including extended cooperation with China on maritime transport of iron ore.Among the deals, Vale said it would expand an existing accord by selling four ore carriers to China Merchants Energy Shipping Co. Ltd and also also signed a memorandum of understanding with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for up to $4 billion in loans and other financial arrangements.China also vowed to lift an import ban on Brazilian beef and signed onto an ambitious project to build a railway from the key southeastern Brazilian port of Santos more than 3,500 kilometers (2,200 miles) to the Peruvian Pacific port of Ilo.- Exponential growth -Bilateral trade between the BRICS developing states has mushroomed over the past decade, with the Asian giant becoming Brazil´s main trading partner in 2009.Trade between China and Latin America as a whole exploded from barely $10 billion in 2000 to $255.5 billion in 2012.Sino-Brazilian trade mushroomed from $6.5 billion in 2003 to $83.3 billion in 2012.Ahead of Li´s arrival late Monday, Jose Graca Lima, head of Asian affairs in the Brazilian foreign ministry, explained that a ""second generation"" of Chinese investment is underway, switching from trade in raw materials to heavy industry and infrastructure.Facilitating the movement of imports from Brazil -- and similarly that of its own exports to Latin America -- is a key Chinese aim, pushing their interest in funding the mooted $10 billion railway project through to Peru.Building the rail link would mean that ""a new path to Asia will open up for Brazil, reducing distances and costs,"" Rousseff told reporters.

The SNGPL had allowed station owners to reopen their businesses following advance payment after the gap of almost seven months.According to sources, the SNGPL has informed station owners to submit Rs 1.2 million as security deposit and has resumed supply of gas to stations whose owners have paid the security amount.

3428,oil down after opec meeting eyes on iran ,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Monday after OPEC decided to maintain its high output levels, while traders were also weighing the possible return of Iranian supplies that have been curtailed by international sanctions against Tehran, analysts said. US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for July delivery fell 59 cents to $58.54 while Brent crude for July eased 56 cents to $62.75 in mid-morning trade. Analysts said investors were mulling the long-term impact on prices after the 12-nation Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) on Friday defied calls to cut output to alleviate a global supply glut that has seen prices slump almost 50 percent over the past year. Instead, they kept their collective target at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for more than three and a half years.OPEC countries are reported to be actually pumping more than 31 million barrels a day, with the risk of more coming on line.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia-Pacific oil and gas practice at business consultancy firm EY, said prices are ""likely to remain volatile"" ahead of a June 30 deadline for Iran and world powers to come to an agreement on curbing Tehran´s nuclear programme.  Six global powers -- Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and the United States -- are trying to nail down a deal to curb Iran´s nuclear ambitions by reducing its stockpiles of enriched uranium and mothballing some of its sites.If the agreement is reached and implemented, the powers have agreed to gradually scale back sanctions imposed since 2012, including on its petroleum industry. Iran has the world´s fourth-largest oil reserves but its exports have fallen from more than 2.2 million barrels per day in 2011 to about 1.3 million because of the sanctions. ""Any likelihood of a deal could act as a trigger for downward movement of crude prices,"" said Gupta. (AFP)

3429,gulf expat workers send home 100 billion repor,"KUWAIT CITY: Foreigners working in the energy-rich Arab states of the Gulf sent more than $100 billion in remittances to their home countries last year, an economic report showed Tuesday.The figure was twice as high as remittances in 2010, an indication of strong growth, the head of economic research at Kuwait Financial Center (Markaz), Raghu Mandagoathur, said in the report.Around 25 million expats live in the Gulf Cooperation Council states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- equal to the native population.The remittances are estimated at 6.2 percent of the combined GDP of the six GCC states of $1.6 trillion, the report said, citing IMF and World Bank figures.In comparison, foreigners in the United States and Britain sent home just 0.7 percent and 0.8 percent of GDP, respectively, it said.Saudi Arabia topped the list with its estimated 10 million expats sending home $44 billion, followed by UAE with 29 billion.Remittances from Kuwait and Qatar were $12 billion and $9.5 billion, respectively, while smaller transfers were made out of Oman and Bahrain, the report said.The majority of Gulf expatriates originate from India, Egypt, the Philippines, Bangladesh and Pakistan, as well as Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Yemen.The report attributed the high level of remittances to curbs applied by GCC states on foreign ownership and investment.And unlike in Western countries, foreigners have no hope of acquiring citizenship in GCC states regardless of the duration of residence.The report advised GCC states to encourage expatriates to invest by launching specialised services and opening up their markets to foreign residents, especially the real estate sector.

A sovereign with a Caa rating is judged to be of poor standing and subject to very high credit risk.Weak government finances, structural inflationary pressures and domestic political uncertainties were adding to Pakistan's external vulnerabilities and debt sustainability, thereby compounding the downward pressure on sovereign creditworthiness, Moodys said.Moody's also said the downgrade was also prompted by an upcoming repayment of $7.5 billion to the International Monetary Fund.

3452,oil prices rise on china gr,"London: Oil prices ended the week firmer Friday, lifted by a recovery in share prices in China, which is the world´s biggest consumer of energy and major buyer of commodities generally.The crude market won a boost also from surging European stock markets, that were lifted mainly by hopes of a deal between Greece and its creditors. The International Energy Agency meanwhile forecast that global oil demand growth would slow in 2016 and that oil production in nations outside the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) would stall.In its first estimates for 2016, the IEA forecast that oil demand would slow next year to 1.2 million barrels per day, compared with an average of 1.4 million barrels per day this year.Meanwhile growth in non-OPEC oil supply ""is expected to grind to a halt in 2016 as lower oil prices and spending cuts take a toll"", the IEA said in its monthly oil report.In trading Friday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in August climbed 42 cents to $53.20 a barrel compared with Thursday´s close.Brent North Sea crude for August advanced 62 cents to stand at $59.23 a barrel in London afternoon deals.- Chinese turbulence -US crude futures had sunk nearly eight percent Monday on worries about slowing global growth, as Greek voters rejected a bailout offer and China moved to calm financial market turbulence.""There are some signs that foreign investors are more optimistic about China´s efforts to arrest the stock slide,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets.""However, I feel much caution should be exercised and it is important to observe the Chinese markets in the coming sessions before calling it a bottom.""Aw added: ""As we have seen in the past, Chinese equities may recover in one session, only to fall straight back into a downward spiral the next day.""Chinese stocks surged for a second day on Friday as a government rescue plan offered a respite from a month-long rout.In a rollercoaster week, the Shanghai market gained 5.18 percent overall, after the government announced additional policies to avoid a market crash.But it is still down 24.9 percent from its closing peak on June 12. The stock market slide of recent weeks was a dramatic reversal of a 150-percent charge in the 12 months to its peak last month, fuelled by tens of millions of retail investors using borrowed funds.China´s economy, the world´s second largest, is already faltering. Gross domestic product expanded 7.4 percent in 2014, the slowest pace since 1990, and weakened further in the first three months of this year.But the International Monetary Fund said Thursday that there was no reason to lose faith in China´s economy because of the bursting stock market bubble.-- Greek relief --The oil market was focused also on Greece amid hopes debt-strapped nation would reach a deal with its creditors after Athens laid out details Thursday of a new bailout plan to save it from financial collapse.The package involves a pensions overhaul and tax hikes in return for debt relief and a rescue loan from the eurozone.Traders are also keeping an eye on negotiations in Vienna between western powers and Iran on a deal to curb Tehran´s nuclear ambitions and allow the lifting of punishing sanctions.Global powers leading the negotiations sought to ramp up the pressure for a deal, but Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif hit back, saying Western countries among the so-called P5+1 group on the other side of the talks were backtracking on previous commitments.A lifting of sanctions will allow Iranian oil to flow back into the global market, adding to a supply glut and helping depress prices, according to analysts.Meanwhile US commercial crude stockpiles rose another 400,000 barrels to 465.8 million barrels in the week to July 3, even as refineries picked up activity. Gasoline inventories also jumped, with the summer holiday driving season in full swing. (AFP)

3456,inflation falls to decade low according to sbp report of july march fy15,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Thursday stressed upon removing structural rigidities of various economic sectors, especially the export sector, in order to shift reliance from debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit and building up of foreign exchange reserves.The first and foremost, exports, the prime source of foreign exchange earnings for the country, have been stagnant in the recent past, and declined during July-March (period) of FY15, the central bank said in its latest report covering economic performance during the third quarter (January-March 2015) of the last fiscal year that ended on June 30, 2015.The report emphasized that as the non-debt inflows remained subdued, the country has to rely on debt inflows for the financing of current account deficit, and building up of liquid FX reserves.Moreover, it said net foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows, though maintained the last years level, could not match the outflow under repatriation of profits/dividends while the modest growth in tax collections continued to be a challenge.Referring to the external sector, it said the sector improved considerably due to (a) the current account, benefiting from a robust growth in workers remittances, higher inflows under Coalition Support Fund, and a sharp reduction in oil prices, posted a notable surplus in Q3-FY15; and (b) the SBPs liquid FX reserves more than doubled the level seen a year ago, enough to finance three months of the countrys import bill.The resulting stability in the exchange rate, together with the government decision to pass-on the benefit of fall in international oil prices to domestic consumers and the prudent monetary management, not only pushed YoY CPI inflation down to a decades low.The report added that the budget deficit during July-March FY15 slightly narrowed to 3.8 percent of GDP, compared with 3.9 percent in the same period last year. FBR tax collections grew by 12.7 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, which were well below the 17.9 percent growth recorded in Jul-Mar FY14. Overall expenditures grew by 8.3 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, against 8.7 percent in the same period FY14. According to the report, the financing of budget deficit indicates that the government did not resort to inflationary borrowing from SBP; instead, it returned a huge sum of Rs 674.4 billion (on cash basis) during July-March FY15.As a result, the government was not only able to contain its borrowing from SBP within the IMF ceiling for end-March 2015, but also met the limit of zero quarterly borrowing prescribed in the SBP Act, 1956.The report also noted that the real GDP grew by 4.24 percent in FY15. Though it was the highest since FY08, it fell short of 5.1 percent target for the year, as most of the challenges to economic activity continued to persist. Agriculture sector posted a slightly higher growth (2.9 percent) in FY15, compared with 2.7 percent in FY14. Large scale manufacturing (LSM) grew by 2.5 percent during Jul-Mar FY15, compared with the 4.6 percent growth during the same period last year. Despite relatively low growth in commodity producing sectors (agriculture and industry), services managed to grow by 5.0 percent in FY15, which was higher than 4.4 percent of last year.

The central bank starts a two-day policy meeting on Tuesday that could result in a September interest rate hike that would strengthen the greenback.""The markets are looking for price guidance from Janet & Co,"" said Ben Le Brun, market analyst at Sydney's OptionsXpress, referring to Fed Chair Janet Yellen and the bank.""There is scope for the dollar bulls to be disappointed this week (which) might be a driver for oil prices and the commodities complex overall,"" Le Brun said.A weaker dollar makes dollar-denominated commodities, including oil, cheaper for consumers using other currencies.Brent crude for September was down 2 cents at $54.60 a barrel as of 0655 GMT after dropping 65 cents in the previous session to $54.62, its lowest close since March 19.US crude for September was down 12 cents at $48.02, after falling 31 cents in the previous session to $48.14, its lowest settlement since March 31. It hit an intra-day low of $47.72 on Friday, the lowest intraday price since April 1.Sparking new worries about a global glut, US oil producers added 21 drilling rigs last week, the biggest rise since April 2014, according to Baker Hughes.The increase in drilling activity came despite a 21 percent collapse in US crude prices from about $61 a barrel in mid-June.

""There are a number of other companies from (South) Korea and Europe that we are talking to who are thinking of setting up assembly plants in Pakistan,"" he said, without naming the firms.Japanese strangleholdUS and European cars dominated Pakistan´s roads in the early years after it gained independence from Britain in 1947.But fuel prices made their compact, efficient Japanese rivals more popular and from the 1960s onwards manufacturers like Toyota, Suzuki and Honda gained a stranglehold on the market.Italy's Fiat made a brief foray in the 1990s, while South Korea´s Hyundai as well as Daewoo-owned Chevrolet tried  and failed  to gain a foothold in the 2000s before the financial crisis forced them to exit.Because Pakistan charges heavy duties on imported cars less than three years old, Japanese companies with in-country assembly operations can set prices significantly above the regional average.The bottom-of-the-range Suzuki Mehran costs the equivalent of $6,300 in Pakistan but sells for around $3,900 in neighbouring India. The most popular Corolla 1.3 sedan starts at 1.6 million rupees ($16,000), but buyers have to wait months or pay $1,500 for prompt delivery.The news that Volkswagen was exploring options to enter the Pakistani market has excited car enthusiasts, who are tired of high prices and limited choices.""I think it is a great idea because Volkswagen cars are value for money and reliability,"" said Romano Karim, a fan of the classic Volkswagen Beetles from the 60s and 70s that can often be seen on Pakistan´s roads.Haji Mohammad Shahzad, chairman of the All Pakistan Motor Dealers Association, added that having Volkswagen in the market would help drive costs down.""The monopoly of big three could be broken if Volkswagen produces at least 20,000-25,000 cars annually,"" Shahzad told AFP.Renewed confidenceGlobal auto giants are attracted by Pakistan´s booming economy, which the International Monetary Fund predicts will grow by 4.5 percent in the next financial year. Investor confidence in the medium-sized economy of $232 billion has improved since a new business-friendly government led by Nawaz Sharif took power in 2013, with Karachi´s share market among the world´s top 10 performers in the past year.The country is also undergoing a major construction boom driven by Chinese investment after President Xi Jinping visited Islamabad in April to unveil a $46 billion investment plan known as the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor.Car sales have also boomed thanks to the growth of car leasing and financing facilities. Sales in the 11 months to May this year rose 30 percent from a year earlier, according to industry group the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association.Baber Kaleem Khan, editor of PakWheels.com magazine, said Volkswagen would be well poised to tap into the lower to mid-range market.""Pakistani automakers haven´t really had much competition because their respective domains are well protected by monopolistic business practices,"" Khan told AFP.""But given VW´s impressive small-range of vehicles, the German automaker can take the market from the ground up and start working to the top.""

3468,gold struggles near multi year ,"MANILA: Gold hovered near a 5-1/2-year low on Wednesday as the dollar strengthened after comments from a Federal Reserve official backed expectations that the U.S. central bank would hike interest rates as early as next month.Atlanta Federal Reserve President Dennis Lockhart has said it would take ""significant deterioration"" in the U.S. economy for him to not support a rate hike in September, according to the Wall Street Journal.Gold, an asset that does not earn interest, has taken a hit given rising risks of a US rate hike. The Fed looks intent on lifting rates this year for the first time since 2006 as the U.S. economy strengthens, particularly its labour market.Spot gold was flat at $1,086.90 an ounce by 0606 GMT. Bullion has stayed largely below $1,100 since breaching that key support level in a late July rout that pulled it to as low as $1,077, its weakest since February 2010.U.S. gold for delivery in December slipped 0.4 percent to $1,086.50 an ounce.""We suspect that we will see a steady grind lower across most commodity complexes, including gold, largely attributable to the strength of the dollar and poor technicals that will only encourage more funds to further increase their short side exposure,"" INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir said.In fresh evidence of a recovering U.S. economy, new orders for U.S. factory goods rebounded strongly in June. The dollar index rose to its highest since April against a basket of major currencies.Gold may languish below $1,100 as investors wait out Friday's U.S. nonfarm payrolls, said MKS Group dealer Samuel Laughlin.Bullion could test $1,080 on Wednesday, he said, following Lockhart's comments although some Chinese demand where onshore premium is around $2 an ounce over the global benchmark is providing some support.Holdings of the SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, dropped further on Tuesday to 21.56 million ounces, the lowest since September 2008.Spot platinum and palladium wallowed near multi-year lows on a global glut and weak demand from the automotive sector.Platinum was unchanged at $951.60 an ounce, after sinking to $940.50 on Tuesday, its lowest since February 2009. Palladium gained 0.5 percent to $595.50 after hitting $586.33 overnight, its weakest since October 2012. Silver slipped 0.4 percent to $14.52 an ounce.

3470,fbr targets 1.05 million income tax returns in 2015,"KARACHI: Desperate to widen the tax base in a country where less then one percent of the population pay taxes, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has set a target to collect 138,000 more returns during the tax year 2015, officials said on Friday. The FBR has fixed a target of 1.05 million income tax returns during the year due to higher tax rates on non-filers. The FBR last year received 0.912 million tax returns. A senior official at Directorate of Broadening of Tax Base (BTB) of FBR said the FBR was estimating over 100,000 new income tax returns to be filed by the taxpayers during tax year 2015. The return filing for tax year 2015 will be completed by December with the filing by corporate sector. The filing of income tax returns for the tax year 2014 has been increased after measures taken in the budget 2015/2016 and it has increased to 912,000. The total number is still low as 3.5 million registered taxpayers are in the country. The directorate has gathered details of transactions on which tax was paid during 2013/2014 for the purposes of bringing new taxpayers in the system. According to details, Rs19.75 billion was collected from 2.46 million commercial and 0.29 million industrial electricity consumers. Similarly, about Rs52 billion of taxes were collected through withholding mechanism from 136.5 million mobile phone and 5.6 million landline telephone subscribers. In the banking system the FBR recorded 30.5 million transactions including saving accounts, national saving schemes and cash withdrawals on which the tax authorities collected over Rs50 billion. The directorate so far issued 344,572 notices to defaulters. Around 72,000 persons filed returns and paid Rs485 million tax. Through those notices, the directorate created demand of Rs16.87 billion and recovered Rs6.42 billion. During the recovery process the tax authorities resorted to harsh measures in 2,326 cases, which included: freezing of 1,366 bank accounts; issued arrest warrant in 343 cases; attached 195 properties and impounded 422 vehicles.

3472,china weakens yuan amid economic and reform b,"Shanghai: China´s central bank on Tuesday devalued its yuan currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar, as authorities seek to push market reforms and bolster the world´s second-largest economy.The surprise move marked the biggest drop since China reformed its currency system in 2005 by unpegging the yuan -- also known as the renminbi (RMB) -- from the greenback.It should make the country´s exports more competitive overseas, but analysts said it could prompt anger in the US.The People´s Bank of China (PBoC) set its daily reference rate for the yuan at 6.2298 to $1, compared with 6.1162 yuan the previous day, effectively 1.86 percent lower.The change came amid speculation China is preparing to widen the yuan´s two percent trading band for the first time since March 2014.The range is calculated from a central ""reference rate"" each day. Before Tuesday, Chinese officials said they based the fixing on a poll of market-makers, but the PBoC´s move means it will now also take into account the previous day´s close and other factors.Beijing has so far kept a tight grip on the currency´s value on fears major swings and volatile capital flows could present financial risk and reduce its control over the economy.That has made the yuan far more stable than other major global currencies and a two percent move in its value is dramatic -- before Tuesday´s announcement it had traded within a roughly 0.4 percent band for four months.

3474,fbr makes e filing must for salaried per,"KARACHI: In a bid to increase the number of income tax returns, the Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has made mandatory for all salaried persons having taxable income to file income tax returns electronically from Tax Year 2015.Through SRO 791(I)/2015 issued on Tuesday, the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 has been amended to make it mandatory for all individuals earning taxable income to file tax return electronically for the tax year 2015, for which the last date is August 31, 2015. Tax experts strongly criticised the move. They said salaried individuals were a soft target, and by forcing salaried persons for filing returns the tax authorities were trying to achieve their desired number.Earlier, the law required a person earning Rs500,000 per year to file tax return electronically. While salaried persons under threshold for income tax payment, ie Rs400,000 were also required to file returns, but it was not mandatory through e-filing.Muhammad Zubair, President, Karachi Tax Bar Association (KTBA) said the changes made by the FBR are disappointing, as this shows they only want to increase the numbers instead of increasing the tax revenue.He said that a large segment of salaried persons fall in the slab of Rs400,000 to Rs500,000, which also includes the lower cadre of any corporate entity. In some cases even a peon of an entity will be filing tax return, he added.It is pertinent to mention here that a large number of the salaried class already files income tax returns on an annual basis. According to data obtained from a report of Tax Reform Commission, around 881,262 total returns were filed in tax year 2013, out of which salary returns were 235,117.Rehan Jafri, General Secretary, Pakistan Tax Bar Association (PTBA) criticised the FBR move and asked the authority to first enable its e-portal to handle such a huge number of filings.He said that the last date of filing the income tax return is August 31 and so far the return forms have not been issued by the FBR. It will create difficulties for taxpayers to file in a short span of time, he said, adding the FBR should have issued the form on July 1 allowing at least two months for filing preparation.The FBRs new online software for filing income tax returns IRIS (Integrated Risk Information System) was criticised last year for deficiencies. Tax experts believe that without addressing the issues it will be another failure for FBR.Shahid Hussain Asad, Member Inland Revenue (Policy) and official spokesman said the measure had been taken to ensure electronic availability of taxpayers data.As per tax laws all the individuals are also required to file a wealth statement along with their return.

3475,oil prices slide to fresh lows in asian trad,"Singapore: Oil prices extended losses in Asia on Wednesday as dealers worried about China´s economy following its surprise currency devaluation, while oversupply concerns also added to downward pressure, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for September delivery fell five cents to $43.03 while Brent crude for September slipped 35 cents to $48.83 in late-morning trade.WTI on Tuesday sank to its lowest level since March 2009, while Brent also fell in London, after China´s central bank moved to devalue its currency by nearly two percent against the US dollar.The People´s Bank of China again lowered the daily fix that sets the value of the Chinese currency against the greenback on Wednesday by 1.62 percent, sending a new shockwave through financial markets.""The Chinese yuan continues to weaken for the second day, which could suggest further weakening of oil prices,"" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst at Phillip Futures in Singapore.Investors fear Beijing´s move signalled concerns over growth in the world´s second-largest economy and top energy consumer, which came after data published over the weekend showed a slump in Chinese trade.It also pushed up the greenback, which strengthened further against Asian currencies on Wednesday, which hurts dollar-denominated commodity prices by making them more expensive for international buyers.Ang said prices were also under pressure after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) said output in July rose by 100,700 barrels per day from the previous month to 31.5 million barrels per day.""An increase in OPEC production is certainly not ideal for the oversupplied market at this point in time,"" Ang said.The producer cartel´s refusal to cut its output level despite sagging demand is seen as a reason for a prolonged global oversupply, which has seen prices fall to almost a third of their mid-2014 peak.Analysts have said the move is an attempt by the cartel´s kingpin Saudi Arabia to defend its market share as it fends off competition from US shale oil.Dealers will next focus on US crude stockpiles data to be released on Wednesday for clues on demand in the world´s top crude consumer, Ang said.

We could see more downsides, given that the current conditions remain unfavourable to oil.""The US Department of Energy on Wednesday said oil stockpiles rose 2.6 million barrels in the week ending August 14, and reported a 300,000 barrel rise at the closely watched Cushing, Oklahoma trading hub.The surprise jump in inventories at a time when they normally fall added to concerns of a global surplus, particularly as signs emerge that demand is faltering in top energy importer China.US banking giant Citigroup said WTI could fall to $32 a barrel, a level not seen since the throes of the financial crisis, pressured by excess supplies.""Oil balances point to further oversupply throughout 2015 begging the question how low can oil go,"" it said in a market commentary, adding that hitting the 2008 low of $32.40 a barrel ""is a conceivable reality.""But Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said he expects WTI to be supported at $40 a barrel in Thursday´s trading session.""Technically, we are still seeing a very bearish momentum, however for prices to break below $40 is going to be an arduous task,"" he said.""We see $40 for WTI to be a strong psychological support.""

It was quoted 103.50/103.70 against the greenback.The rupee also breached its support level of 101 and closed at 102.02 versus dollar in the interbank market.The rupee has depreciated 3.5 percent since August 2014. The [interest] spread on buying and selling of the dollar between interbank and open markets has widened to Rs2. The State Bank has clearly instructed that the spread should not exceed 25 paisas.Malik Bostan, President Forex Association of Pakistan said the open currency market was volatile due to rise in dollar demand from Hajj pilgrims and imposition of 0.3 percent withholding tax on banking transactions for non-filers, who are now trading in dollar to avoid the tax.Hajj flights started from August 17 and will end next month. Therefore, Bostan said people have started buying dollar and Saudi Riyal for their journey.Meanwhile, the head of the central banks foreign exchange department, in a meeting with the representatives of exchange companies, directed them to bring stability in the kerb market by ensuring smooth supply of the foreign currencies.Bostan said the SBP ordered the exchange companies, during the meeting, to use biometric verification system in foreign exchange dealings for due diligence of the customer.The SBP said it would provide foreign exchange to the exchange companies to curb the shortage, Bostan claimed.It was also suggested that companies would not sell or buy single dollar without providing the CNIC (computerised national identity card) from the customer.

3482,pak rupee to remain stable sb,"KARACHI: The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) said on Tuesday that it is cognisant of the global developments related to markets and is keenly observing its impact on the domestic economy as well. SBP believes that Pak Rupee will remain stable going forward and may even strengthen depending on the relative movement of international currencies, said an SBP statement today.On Monday (August 24), financial markets across the globe witnessed turbulence and the panic was most visible in the stock markets. Earlier, the foreign exchange markets also had their share in this global turmoil. Since the start of devaluation of Chinese Yuan on August 11, currency depreciation around the globe particularly in the developing countries has accelerated. Many of these countries have allowed their currencies to depreciate primarily to maintain their trade competitiveness against China. Pakistan is also a part of the global economies and cannot remain immune to the developments around the globe. This fact raised expectations about a possible impact on the domestic economy and a downward movement of the exchange rate. As a result on August 24, 2015 Pak Rupee depreciated against the US Dollar to close at Rs 104.50. This translates into a single day movement of the currency by 2.4 percent and a cumulative depreciation of 2.6% percent since the beginning of this fiscal year. It is important to realise that this positioning is driven by international currency movements and not due to any weakness in the domestic economy. The macroeconomic stability achieved through sustained improvements in economic fundamentals is very much intact and these recent developments do not pose any serious challenge to it.Our external sector is robust and reserves are at historically high level.The statement added that, Nevertheless it is keenly watching the international economic developments and its impact on our domestic economy. It is also watching the rent seekers who tend to take advantage of such situations and cause damage to the economy by their speculative activities. SBP stands ready to take any measure to ensure stability in the markets and will deal with such unscrupulous elements with strong measures.

3483,adb announces new 1.2 bn annual package for paki,"KARACHI: The Asian Development Bank said Tuesday it has approved a new assistance programme for Pakistan worth $1.2 billion annually, to improve infrastructure and create jobs. The Manila-based bank said Pakistan, which has suffered sluggish growth in recent years, was on track to meet targets for cutting poverty. But it said overall development was below potential and further institutional reforms were needed. Tax collection in Pakistan is tiny, severely hampering the government´s ability to manage its finances. A chronic crisis in the power sector -- made worse by poorly targeted subsidies -- is also a major brake on growth. ""The main challenge in Pakistan was to deliver higher, sustained and inclusive growth to cut poverty and create productive jobs for the growing labour force,"" ADB Pakistan country director Werner Liepach said in a statement. The new programme, which runs until 2019, will target six sectors including energy, transport and public sector management, the ADB said. The funds will support improvements to highways and provincial roads, as well as to power generation and transmission and bus rapid transit schemes in Karachi and other cities.

3485,oil prices up in asian trad,"Singapore: Oil rose in Asia Thursday as dealers digested a mixed US energy report showing a dip in crude inventories, but barely any decline in production despite sinking prices.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for October delivery gained 86 cents to $39.46 while Brent crude for October rose $1.07 to $44.21 in late-morning trade.The US Department of Energy said Wednesday US crude supplies unexpectedly fell by 5.5 million barrels for the week ending August 21, indicating healthy demand.However, US crude production slipped a scant 11,000 barrels a day in the same period, keeping output above 9.3 million barrels and not far from a decades-high production level.In another bearish indicator, gasoline supplies increased by 1.7 million barrels, adding to concerns of a global glut of energy supplies.Despite the gains in Asian trading, Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said the mixed report compounded ""negative sentiment after worldwide falls in equities that helped drag fuel prices to six and a half year lows"".Oil prices hit their lowest levels since early 2009 on Monday over concerns China´s slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped drive its growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan two weeks ago largely fuelled the economic fears that sparked the rout, which also saw heavy losses in most global commodities and equity markets.London-based Capital Economics predicted a rebound in commodities markets, saying that ""much of the bad news was already baked in the cake before the latest sell-off"".""We think commodity prices will now stabilise and perhaps even edge higher and we disagree with the doomsday scenarios for China´s economy that are currently doing the rounds,"" it said.

3489,petrol shortage in several parts of paki,"KARACHI: A strike called by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association has caused a severe shortage of petrol in Karachi, Quetta and several parts of the country.The shortage comes as the government notified a decrease of Rs 3 per litre in the prices of petrol and diesel from Tuesday. Chairman Petroleum and CNG Association Shabir Sulemanji said earlier today that 30 percent of fuel stations in Karachi have run out of petrol and diesel due to the strike, expressing hope that situation would improve by Wednesday.But Geo News correspondent Ali Imran said that by now petrol was available on only about 20 to 25 percent pumping stations  those too most likely on the outskirts of Karachi. He said that there were also reports of fuel stations illegally selling petrol in black at exorbitant rates of up to Rs100 per litre.Read more: Prices of petrol, diesel slashed by Rs3 per litre Some parts of Sindh and Punjab have also begun to feel the effect of the shortage, with fears that the shortage may spiral out of control. The strike by the Oil Tanker Owner's Association, called to protest against sales tax imposed on transportation of oil, is being seen as the main reason for the shortage which is causing great difficulty for consumers.Experts and observers say the effects of the shortage are exacerbated by pumping stations not keeping enough stock and consumers waiting for prices to go down to refill their fuel tanks.

3491,onion prices shoot up after indiabangladesh place import order,"KARACHI: Pakistan is poised to fetch higher export orders for onion this year after India, its competitor, and Bangladesh returned to the international markets to overcome local shortage in supplies, traders have said.""Pakistan has registered an increase in demand from the overseas markets in the last couple of weeksIndia has recently started importing onion from Pakistan via the Wagah border,"" said Haji Shahjahan, an exporter.""Total export of the country would remain steady at 450,000 to 500,000 ton this year, which is similar to the previous year,"" he estimated. The countrys annual export size of the commodity stood at 250,000 to 300,000 tons in recent years, he added.Shahjahan said that on an average, some five trucks of onions have been crossing the Wagah border daily to enter into India from Pakistan. Each truck carries some 15 tons of onions.Under these circumstances, prices at Karachi's wholesale market at Super Highway have shot to Rs1,600/40kg of onions from Rs1,000-1,100/40kg a few days ago. Accordingly, the commodity in retail has increased to around Rs40-50/kg from Rs30-40/kg a few days ago.He linked the hike in the prices with the drop in supplies to the market. ""Supplies are sometimes slowed down when the crop finishes in one area and harvesting begins in other areas...These days, onions from Balochistan are available in the markets nationwide."" Sindh would begin harvesting the new crop from October, and will continue in full swing until November-December. The crop would last till April 2016.He, however, said Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and UAE remain the biggest importers of Pakistani onion.Attributing the price fluctuation to the demand supply gap, Shahjahan said Malaysia has been importing 50-60 containers (of 25 tons each) every week, UAE 40-50 containers, whereas Sri Lanka buys 30-40 containers of onion from Pakistan every week. ""On a weekly average, Pakistan exports 8,000 to 10,000 tons of onion,"" he said.Ahmed Ali Baloch, another exporter, said ""I have just received an export order from Bangladesh, and I am evaluating the export price.""Reportedly, Bangladesh usually imports onion from India. The export country {India}, however, is itself experiencing shortage in local supplies and price-hike these days. The situation has also convinced Bangladesh to divert its import orders to other countries.Pakistan, a common neighbour to both the countries, with a local production estimated at 2.5 million tons this year, may help them overcome a part of their local shortages.Egypt, Iran, an Afghanistan may also help them overcome the crises, it was learnt.Baloch added that Pakistan could fetch higher exports than the estimated amount if the government did not set a maximum limit per exporter. ""According to the rules, one exporter cannot load more than one container of onion in each vessel may be each vessel carries 100 containers.""Shahjahan added two to three vessels of onions leave the Karachi Port every week.

3492,strike piles up trade cargoes prolonged stand off feared,"KARACHI: A strike by freight forwarders and air cargo agents is piling up cargo containers at the countrys main port as delays in offloading and taking on new cargo is causing fears that a prolonged stand-off will cost the economy billions of rupees.The strike, observed in protest against eight percent turnover tax, entered the second day on Wednesday, bringing the external trade to nearly halt, said a protesting leader.Pakistan International Freight Forwarders Association (PIFFA) and Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) had announced strike for indefinite period until government resolves all the issues, which include withdrawal of the turnover tax.Farukh Iqbal, chairman of Air Cargo Agents Association of Pakistan (ACAAP) said there was no bill of leading for exporters to ship goods through dry ports/sea ports/airports/bonded container freight station.No one from governments side came forward to negotiate with us, he said.We have written several letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, finance ministry and Prime Ministers secretariat, but the government was not ready to listen to our grievances.Even various trade bodies took up this issue with the government, which seems to be indifferent to trade and commerce, he added. The cargo agents leader said since no government official had contacted them on Wednesday they decided to continue the strike.Our members are not responsible or liable for any direct or consequential losses suffered by trade due to strike as government has forced our member companies to take the extreme decision to close businesses in protest against the imposition of this unjust tax, which itself means closure of businesses, he said.An official at a leading terminal operator of Karachi port told The News that the strike had already slowed down the activities.If this situation persists for another four to five days the goods waiting for clearance will pile up to create menace, he said. And, it will take 20 to 25 days or even more to do clearance in addition to jack up the operational cost for exporters and importers in form of extra port duties.He added that the government is not realising the fact.Freight forwarders didnt issue any bill of leading for exports and there was no delivery order for lifting the import consignment at terminals. If the situation persists it will create handling issues.Perishable export/import items can be ruined if not cleared on time.The terminal operator said clearing agents and freight forwarders dont work on high turnovers and higher taxes can lead to the closure of their businesses.A leading exporter Jawed Bilwani said governments non-serious attitude to resolve any industry issue is marring trade. The countrys exports are already suffering and with the ongoing strike of the freight forwarders and other stakeholders will further hamper the exports.Bilwani said last year good transporters called strike and the government didnt seriously take the issue. It was only after 12 days, during which traders sustained huge losses the government came for negotiation with the protestors.He said the present government allows an issue to blow out of proportion before coming for the rescue.Fawad Ijaz Khan, Patron-in-Chief of Pakistan Leather Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association said the government has failed to resolve the issues facing freight forwarders and air cargo agents.We have been trying to contact the various ministries, including finance and commerce ministries, but no one was available to listen to our grievances, Khan said.Our members are worried about their consignments and their orders might be cancelled if not shipped on time.Shabbir Ahmed, former chairman of Pakistan Bedwear Exporters Association said the government should seriously take notice of the matter and immediately resolve the issues of the logistics sector. Ahmed said small exporters will suffer the most due to the strike.

3493,oil prices swing wildly in china uncertainty,"London: Fragile financial markets are grappling with wild swings in world oil prices, unnerved by uncertainty over global supplies and the demand outlook from China.By the close of business Monday, the price had shot up 27 percent in just three days for the US benchmark contract, West Texas Intermediate for October delivery, rebounding from six and a half year lows.But they skidded again Tuesday when weak Chinese manufacturing data cemented concerns over demand from the world´s biggest commodities consumer.Later in the week oil prices got a boost from the European Central Bank, which on Thursday held out the prospect of yet more stimulus for the eurozone economies if needed.By the end of the week, crude oil prices were trading in London on Friday evening barely changed.Brent North Sea crude sold at $49.95 a barrel -- down from $50.17 a week earlier. The WTI contract traded at $46.22, up from $45.22.Crude oil, the world economy´s most important raw material, has roughly halved in price in a year.""The fall in commodity prices has looked particularly dramatic because it has included oil,"" said Julian Jessop, chief global economist and head of commodities at London-based research group Capital Economics.While many raw materials have been declining in price since 2011 as China´s booming economy began to slow, oil´s price had been propped up by a perceived threat to supply after the Arab Spring, Jessop said in an interview.""Once the concerns about the potential threat to supply from the Arab Spring disappeared and were replaced by the reality of massive oversupply because of the shale revolution in the United States and OPEC´s response of keeping production high when people had thought it might cut, then oil tanked,"" the analyst said.Keeping pressure on oil prices, Iraq has managed to boost production this year by 1.5 million barrels per day despite the conflict with extremists including Daesh group and Iran is set to raise exports as sanctions are lifted after an agreement was reached over its nuclear programme.Despite the uncertainty on commodity markets, the price of gold -- a safe haven -- lost its shine over the past week, hurt by a rally in the US dollar.The precious metal also lost its lure as a haven at as volatile Chinese markets took a holiday on Thursday and Friday to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II.On the London Bullion Market, gold was trading at $1,118.25 dollars an ounce Friday against $1.135 dollars a week before.

US financial markets are closed Monday for the Labor Day public holiday.""The realisation that the Fed will still raise interest rates this year... dampened market sentiment,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets In Singapore.A rate hike would likely strengthen the greenback, making dollar-priced oil more expensive to holders of weaker currencies, hurting demand and prices.Analysts said dealers are awaiting a slew of global economic data this week for clues about demand, with ample supplies boosted by relentless US and OPEC production.The Chinese government is scheduled to release monthly trade and inflation figures, as well as industrial output, fixed-asset investment and retail sales in the coming days.Oil prices have fluctuated wildly in recent weeks on uncertainty about Fed monetary policy as well as worries about the growth in world number-one energy consumer China.The eurozone´s second-quarter gross domestic product figures are due Tuesday.

This compared with a fall of 8.9 percent in July.Imports dropped 14.3 percent, from an 8.6 percent decrease in July.""This data just reinforces the view we are still seeing weakness in the Chinese economy and this data point suggests we have not seen a bottom yet,"" Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets, told AFP.""China´s economy remains a worry for the wider world economy and global asset markets,"" he added.The data was the first in a string of economic figures this week that will be used as a barometer of the state of the Chinese economy, the world´s second-biggest and a crucial driver of global growth.Oil prices have come under pressure from concerns that China´s slowing economy will curb demand for the commodities that have helped feed its astonishing growth over the past three decades.The devaluation of the yuan on August 11 fuelled economic fears, sparking a slump in world equities sending commodities, as measured by the Bloomberg Commodity Index of 22 raw materials, to a 16-year-low before stabilising near current levels.Oil prices are down almost 30 percent from this year´s closing peak in May, according to Bloomberg News data.Analysts said dealers would next scrutinise the latest weekly US petroleum report due Thursday, a day later than usual due to a holiday on Monday.US crude reserves currently sit near an eight-decade peak due to high production levels despite tepid demand.Dealers had been hoping that an uptick in US demand, coupled with a slowdown in output, could whittle down the huge global supplies that were a key reason for the collapse in prices from around $120 in June last year.

3501,dubai property developers upbeat despite falling pri,"DUBAI: Dubai property developers are still turning out some larger-than-life projects even though prices are heading south again after clawing back a good chunk of their losses in the 2008 crash.  The Gulf emirate´s annual Cityscape property fair opened Tuesday with developers foreseeing price declines of about 15 percent this year, yet confident there would be no return to the days when huge projects were abandoned half finished.Scale models of new skyscrapers, sprawling villa compounds and leisure centres, including a new indoor ski slope, were rolled out by several companies.Analysts have signalled a slide in property values, which had recovered significantly in the past two years after shedding half of their value in the 2008 global financial crisis. Dubai had shaken world markets when it signalled that it might default on huge debts incurred after borrowing extensively to build those ambitious projects.Thanks to the robust trade, tourism and transport sectors, the economy has since steadied. ""Residential prices have fallen maybe nine or 10 percent this year,"" said Craig Plumb, Middle East and North Africa research director for Chicago-based investment management company Jones Lang LaSalle.""We expect prices to go down further over the rest of the year,"" saying the decline has ""more to do with what is going on globally. Things like (falling) oil prices and the global nervousness with the Chinese economy slowing.""""The Dubai residential market is very much affected by what´s going on in the rest of the world because a large number of people buying here are investors coming from overseas,"" said Plumb.""There is a negative sentiment largely driven by oil prices... It pushed stock prices down and pushed sentiment against the residential market as well.""The city-state, one of seven that make up the United Arab Emirates, is the largest and one of very few markets in the region that has opened up to foreign free-hold ownership. Plumb said prices are likely to fall for 12 more months, while forecasting the drop for this year at 15 percent. London-based property consultancy Knight Frank has reportedly put the annual drop to June at over 12 percent. Cluttons, another London consultancy, expects villa prices to lose up to seven percent in the second half of the year after dropping five percent in the first six months. Signs of price softening had begun to show as a result of strict regulations introduced by UAE financial authorities to avoid a new bubble, including mortgage caps.  In particular, they put a cap on mortgage financing at 75 percent for a first purchase and 60 percent for a second one. This priced out of the market those who could not make down payments of 25 percent or more. As a result, Plumb said, prices are not expected to nosedive as they did in the crisis.  ""We are seeing a much more stable market and that is a sign of better regulation.""Developers undeterredAgainst that background, Cluttons said more than 40,000 units have been announced this year, with in excess of 20,000 to be delivered by 2017. Ziad Chaar, managing director of Dubai developer DAMAC Properties, said ""with 53 billion dirham ($14 billion) recorded transactions in the first six months... we are sure that this market is a good market.""Chaar cited a growing population and healthy economic expansion, including a rising number of tourists and modern infrastructure, in addition to a stable exchange rate and political stability compared with a wider region in turmoil. ""If we did not know that this market is strong, and that there is a very strong demand, we would not have launched these projects,"" he said, pointing to scale models of various luxurious projects. One of the projects on display at Cityscape is Meydan One, which includes plans for the world´s highest residential tower, at 711 metres (2,333 feet) high. Dubai is already home to the world´s tallest building, Burj al-Khalifa, with stands at 829.8 metres. At foot of Meydan One, a 1.2-kilometre indoor ski slope is set to break Dubai´s own world record, Ski Dubai, which boasts a 400-metre slope.  Dubai´s Nakheel Properties, developer of Palm Jumeirah and the World Islands, announced that it aims to bring 10,000 units on to the market in the Jebel Ali area. Savills, another British real estate consultancy, ranks the UAE as the world second-best country for residential investment, after only the United States. It said Dubai´s market has ""matured"" and that softening prices are expected to pick up again in mid-2016, as the country prepares to host the Expo 2020 trade fair.

3502,withholding tax traders businessmen observing strike today,"LAHORE: Traders and business community is observing countrywide complete shutter down strike, halting business activities today (Wednesday) against the imposition of withholding tax on all types of banking transactions.This would be the second countrywide strike on the same issue. Earlier, the business community succeeded in observing the strike across country, pressurising the Federal Board of Revenue to halve the rate of withholding tax on banking transactions, and extending the date of implementation of the said tax.However, a faction of traders refused the FBR incentive, sticking to their single point agenda of withdrawal of the withholding tax from banking transactions, which has compelled the other groups to join hands with them and show their muscle power to the government.On Tuesday, different factions of the traders in two different press conferences announced the complete shutter down strike for today. They said that after this strike, they will announce their future plans of protests and strikes which would be for an indefinite period.They said that businessmen had never refused to pay taxes, but the government instead of taxing those who were already in the net, should bring new people in to the tax net.They said that this tax had not only made life of the traders miserable, but also destroyed the whole banking sector, as it was now facing a collective loss of Rs878 billion.After the traders and business community, the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry (LCCI) also announced to observe the September 9 strike.

3513,government stresses coal based power generati,"KARACHI: The government believes that coal-based power generation is the best source of energy in the wake of depleting gas reserves.The National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) said efforts must be made to change the energy mix towards cheaper fuels.With the depleting natural gas reserves in the country and relatively longer lead time for the construction of hydroelectric power projects, coal power plants are considered the best option in the short- and medium-term planning, reads a Nepras decision pertaining to the generation licence application of Siddiqsons Energy.NEPRA awarded a generation licence to Siddiqsons Energy Limited for 350-megawatt coal-based thermal facility at Port Qasim with a cost of approximately $600 million.The project is expected to be commissioned by December 31, 2018, while the company is required to provide a certificate on bi-annual basis, confirming that the operation of its generation facility is in line with the environment standards as prescribed by the relevant competent authority.NEPRA said electricity is a fundamental element for the economic growth of any country. The electricity consumption per capita has a strong correlation to the social development and economic indices.Increasing electricity consumption per capita can directly stimulate faster economic growth and indirectly achieve enhanced social development, the authority said.In short, the economic growth of any country is directly linked with the availability of safe, secure, reliable and cheaper supply of electricity.The authority said for sustainable development, all types of electric power generation resources, including coal (imported/indigenous), hydel, wind, solar and others must be tapped and developed on priority basis both in public and private sectors.The existing energy mix of the country is heavily skewed towards the costlier thermal generation facilities operating on furnace oil.The import of expensive furnace oil results in depletion of the precious foreign exchange reserves of the country, affecting the macro and microeconomic stability, read the ruling.An increase in the consumer end tariff results in higher inflation but it also affects the competitiveness of the local industry with its foreign peers.It further said it is vital that indigenous and imported coal projects are given priority for power generation and their development is encouraged to reduce the demand-supply gap and to achieve sustainable development.

3517,oil prices ease in asi,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Monday as investors looked for further clues about the health of the Chinese and US economies, the world´s top crude consumers.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery eased 48 cents to $45.22 and Brent crude for November dipped 47 cents to $48.13.Markets were rocked last week by news that a key gauge of manufacturing activity in China fell to a six-and-a-half-year low in September, the latest sign of slowdown in growth for the world´s second-biggest economy.""For most commodities, a ´hard landing´ in China would be a far greater threat than a gradual tightening from the Fed,"" research firm Capital Economics said.It said that the manufacturing data is likely to improve over the remainder of the year.The US Federal Reserve held off raising interest rates during its September meeting, but on Thursday Fed chief Janet Yellen said she still expects a lift-off this year and that concerns about weaker global growth likely will not affect that plan.Focus this week ""is likely to remain on China and particularly the equity market, which has recently shown signs of stabilising, and on the US ahead of the employment report on Friday"", Capital Economics said in a market commentary.A rise in interest rates would likely boost the US currency, making dollar-priced oil more expensive for holders of weaker units, hurting demand.Prices are also under pressure owing to the prospect of Iranian oil returning to the oversupplied market following a landmark nuclear deal with major world powers reached in July.Under the agreement, the west will lift crippling economic sanctions if Iran curbs its nuclear ambitions, allowing the country to increase its oil exports. Tehran has denied western claims it is aiming to build an atomic bomb.Prices are expected to be volatile during the week, analysts said.""With no major economic data announcements during the week except for the US unemployment rate due next Friday, crude oil prices will continue to seesaw,"" said Sanjeev Gupta, who heads the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY.

Last year the prices of sacrificial animals had dropped considerably but on the contrary the rates of the cattle went through the roof this time around. So much so that people who went to the market to buy the sacrificial animal on the third day of Eid in a hope to get some discount had to return empty handed.According to the sales figures from Super Highways cattle market till the third day of Eid, 340,000 cows/bulls were sold. The sale of goats touched 140,000 while 3500 camels were sold till the third day.

3520,nepra makes consumers pay billions mor,"ISLAMABAD: Nepra allowed increase in the losses of distribution companies (Discos) by up to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent in 2004 in the power tariff, inflicting a loss of Rs2.1 billion per annum, reveals the governments official plan of managing the circular debt agreed to with the IMF, a copy of which is available with The News.Under the circular debt management plan, the government intends to reduce the circular debt from Rs314 billion (as of end of June 2015) to Rs212 billion by financial year ending June 30, 2018 while keeping within the target of 0.4 percent of GDP for subsidies to the power sector (about Rs128 billion) and 4 percent fiscal deficit. At the end of each month, the circular debt will be maintained below the cap of Rs314 billion. The circular debt management plan (or capping mechanism) will include reducing the increase of circular debt (flow) as well as the stock (outstanding amount). Policy induced public sector power entity debt including Power Holding Company Limited (PHCL) debt will be reduced from Rs335 billion to Rs220 billion by 2018. Collection from government customers will be rationalized, and subsidies will be on actual basis and paid according to schedule. Independent energy experts say the power sector requires just over Rs1 trillion to run itself and if one percent loss appears in the system, it accounts for Rs10 billion. This means the consumers are currently paying over Rs150 billion in the tariff just under the head of losses. However, Nepra, which is supposed to pressurize Discos to bring down losses, has accommodated the inefficient power sector by increasing the losses to 15.3 percent from 13.03 percent. Nepra spokesperson admitted that the regulator had increased the losses of Discos by up to 15.3 percent in the tariff from 13.03 percent insisting that it will add the additional burden of Rs2.1 billion, saying one percent loss means damage of just Rs1 billion that will be recovered from the consumers in the tariff. Nepra had earlier fixed the allowed losses for Discos for 2013-14 at 13.02 percent compared to 18.7 percent. The 5.6 percent difference between determined loss and actual loss accumulated as circular debt of Rs33.6 billion in financial year 2014. Now the regulator for financial year 2015 allowed 15.3 percent compared with expected losses of 18.70 percent, narrowing the gap between allowed and actual losses, but it will still result in accumulation of circular debt of Rs32 billion due to increase in generation. In the short term, there is little that can be done about the flow because the tariffs have been determined. Nepra as a condition of its determinations requires Discos to conduct a study on technical losses to justify the need for increase and to set out future loss reduction initiatives, to be conducted by independent consultants but the results are unlikely to show an effect until financial year 2016 determinations. For the purposes of this circular debt management plan, it is assumed that reductions in losses will reduce the flow of circular debt from Rs32 billion to Rs11 billion. The privatization programme, according to the document, is also likely to reduce excess line losses to the extent of the companies that will be privatized. With expected privatization of three Discos in FY 2016, multi-year tariff (MYT) will have been determined instead of annual tariff determinations and this will give incentives to the new owners to improve losses against the Nepra benchmarks; in any event, the costs of any underperformance will be the responsibility of the new owner. For the Discos not privatized, the surcharge mechanism will still be used to rationalize subsidies dealing with Sector Inefficiencies and recover costs of service.

3526,air france hr manager almost lynched in job cut pr,"PARIS: Air France's human resources manager had his shirt stripped from him as he was ""almost lynched"" on Monday by workers protesting at a plan to cut 2,900 jobs from the struggling airline.Bosses were unveiling a revamped restructuring plan after pilots rejected an earlier proposal to work longer hours. But the board meeting was cut short when hundreds of striking workers stormed into the airline´s headquarters in Roissy, outside Paris.Human resources manager Xavier Broseta ""was almost lynched"", according to one union delegate, and had his shirt ripped off as he clambered over barriers to escape, helped by security guards. CEO Frederic Gagey also made a hasty exit, and the board said the meeting would not resume on Monday.The management condemned the ""physical violence"", and said it would file complaints to the police. Transport Minister Alain Vidalies said the violence was ""unacceptable"". ""They do nothing to advance the search for a solution for Air France,"" he said in a statement.The loss-making airline, which employs 52,000 people, is struggling in the face of fierce competition from global rivals.It had tried to convince pilots, who earn up to 250,000 euros ($280,000) a year, to fly 100 more hours annually for the same salary, but talks broke down last week with pilots saying the plan amounted to an effective pay cut. The French government, which owns a 17.6-percent stake, has criticised the pilots, with Prime Minister Manuel Valls denouncing their ""hardline"" attitude.""If Air France does not evolve then it puts itself in danger,"" Valls said at the weekend.- ´Spectators to a crash´ -Four unions announced a strike to coincide with Monday´s meeting. It was not clear how many staff were taking part, but the airline said flights would be unaffected beyond some check-in delays. Not all staff support the pilots, who also led a record-long strike a year ago that cost the company nearly half a billion euros.""Ground staff, stewards and hostesses feel they have made enormous efforts without ending up in a position to influence decisions,"" Beatrice Lestic, of the CFDT union, told Le Parisien newspaper. ""They are now spectators to a crash in which they will be the first victims,"" she said.Seeking to sharpen its competitive edge against main European rivals Lufthansa and British Airways-Iberia, the management´s new proposals include ending five long-haul routes, reducing the frequency of other flights, and selling 14 planes over the next two years.Although the company says it favours voluntary departures, Gagey has indicated compulsory redundancies may be necessary for the first time, ""otherwise we would not make hoped-for progress in terms of productivity"".Sources at Monday´s meeting said the plan includes the possibility of dismissing 300 pilots, 900 air hostesses and stewards, and 1,700 ground staff. The company already shed 5,500 posts via voluntary departures between 2012 and 2014 as it battled competition from low-cost carriers and Gulf airlines. Pilots were also behind a record-long two-week strike in September 2014, which knocked 416 million euros off turnover and was described as ""catastrophic for the French aviation sector"" in a joint statement from key industry unions.The striking pilots opposed the expansion of Air France´s low-cost subsidiary Transavia.Air France, which merged with Dutch national carrier KLM in 2004, is trying to cut costs over two years by 1.8 billion euros.A source close to the deal told AFP Monday that as part of its cost-cutting plan, Air France is to enter into discussions about cancelling all or some of the Boeing 787s it has on order.The airline ordered 25 of the 787-9 Dreamliners in 2011.The source said: ""We are going to contact our suppliers from tomorrow to ask them if possible to cancel the scheduled delivery of the 787 planes.""Discussions will be opened and they could end in cancellations, that´s our approach.""

The hard-won deal to create the world´s largest free-trade area, encompassing 40 percent of the global economy, came after five days of round-the-clock talks in an Atlanta hotel.President Barack Obama, who made the TPP a priority of his second term, said the accord reached in Georgia ""reflects America´s values and gives our workers the fair shot at success they deserve."" ""When more than 95 percent of our potential customers live outside our borders, we can´t let countries like China write the rules of the global economy,"" Obama said in a statement. ""We should write those rules, opening new markets to American products while setting high standards for protecting workers and preserving our environment.""More than 18,000 taxes imposed by various countries on US products will be eliminated thanks to the partnership, he added. - ´Shape the future´ -The accord involves significant market openings from Canada, the United States and Japan but also sets controversial new patent standards for cutting-edge biologic drugs and demands countries like Vietnam, Mexico and Malaysia improve labor standards.""This agreement in my view is truly transformational,"" said Canada Trade Minister Ed Fast.""The magnitude and importance of rules for 21st century issues can´t be underscored enough.... It will shape the future for many trade agreements in this 21st century."" The talks went four days past deadline to resolve conflicts over Canada and Japan opening up their dairy markets to New Zealand exports, and objections from Australia, Peru and Chile to the US push for longer biologic patent protections.Trade ministers said the landmark deal addresses new issues like data trade, foreign investment protections and intellectual property that have not been covered in multilateral trade pacts of the past. New Zealand Trade Minister Tim Groser said his side of the talks went to 5 am Monday morning before an agreement was set.The deal is ""profoundly important and beneficial to the generations of people in our respective countries,"" he said.The accord still must be signed and ratified by the respective countries, which also include Singapore and Brunei.In Canada, facing a national election in two weeks, and in the United States, with elections coming in one year, that could prove particularly difficult.US members of Congress have already warned that they will not ratify any deal that gives up too much in US interests.Powerful Senator Orrin Hatch warned Monday that he will scour the deal ""to determine whether our trade negotiators have diligently followed the law so that this trade agreement meets Congress´s criteria and increases opportunity for American businesses and workers.""

3528,oil extends gains in asi,"Singapore: Oil extended gains in Asia Monday as a decline in US drilling pointed to a slowdown in production, but concerns over demand remain after a disappointing US jobs report.A report from Baker Hughes Inc. said the number of active rigs in the United States fell by 26 to 614 last week, the lowest in five years, helping ease concerns over the global crude oversupply that has depressed prices.But poor unemployment data from the US continued to weigh on the market.The US Labor Department said Friday that jobs growth in the world´s biggest economy and top oil consumer faltered in September and the labour market weakened across the board.This has stoked concerns about demand for the commodity at a time when the Chinese economy is also slowing down amid a crude supply glut, analysts said.The US economy added a disappointing 142,000 jobs during the month, well below analyst estimates of 205,000 and the August jobs level of 173,000 was revised sharply lower to 136,000, surprising analysts.The July number also was lowered, bringing the average for the past three months to 167,000 jobs, lagging behind the 200,000-plus growth trend seen earlier in the year and in 2014.The unemployment rate, measuring those without work but actively seeking jobs, was unchanged as expected at 5.1 percent, the lowest level since 2008.The jobs data suggested that the US economy was being affected by the China-driven global slowdown and market volatility.In morning Asia trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was up 11 cents to $45.65 and Brent crude for November jumped 15 cents to $48.28 a barrel.Both contracts also rose on Friday after a decline in US oil drilling bolstered hopes of lower production to ease the global oversupply.""The disappointing US jobs report for September will clearly do little to improve investor confidence in the global economy,"" research house Capital Economics said.""Yes, it will probably delay the first interest rate hike from the Fed until early next year.""Analysts had predicted the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates either this month or in December after policymakers held back during a meeting in September.The Fed has said the timing of a rate increase will depend on the health of the US economy.

3531,oil prices sustain rally,"Singapore: Buoyant oil prices sustained a rally in Asia Wednesday driven by hopes the crude supply glut would ease and expectations the US central bank would hold off from raising interest rates.A softening of the US currency also helped bolster prices as the dollar-priced commodity becomes cheaper for holders of weaker units, spurring demand, analysts said.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for November delivery rose 55 cents to $49.08 and Brent crude for November advanced 40 cents to $52.32 a barrel in late-morning trade.Prices fell to six-year lows in August on strong production from the United States and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, but have since crept higher.The recent rally began last week after data showed a drop in US drilling activity, raising hopes this would help ease the oversupply.The US Department of Energy has forecast production to decline to an average of 8.9 million barrels per day next year from 9.2 million in 2015.Expectations that the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, would not raise interest rates this year because of the weak global economy also boosted oil prices, analysts said.""We no longer look for lift-off until the first quarter of 2016. It may not come then either,"" DBS Bank said.Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore, said an interest rate hike seemed less likely after the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on Tuesday downgraded its growth forecasts for the world economy.The global economy will expand just 3.1 percent this year and 3.6 percent next year, the IMF predicted, revising downward its previous forecasts by 0.2 percentage points in both cases.""It is no secret that the IMF wants the Fed to delay its planned rate hike until next year, and the economic undercurrents increasingly lean towards that direction,"" Aw said.""Furthermore, the IMF sees risks for emerging economies.""A rate increase will typically boost the dollar, making oil more expensive, hurting demand and prices.

3533,water short pakistani farmers test less thirsty way to grow ri,"ISLAMABAD: Erratic monsoon rains have made it increasingly hard for rice farmer Sardar Muhammad to bring in a good harvest. But learning how to plant seed directly in his fields  rather than transplanting seedlings, as farmers have for centuries in parched Punjab province  is helping him manage scarce water better and get a decent crop. Growing rice this way ""requires less labour, less irrigation"", he said. The rice seed is sown straight into moist soil and does not require continuous submergence.So far 30 farmers have applied the improved, water-saving rice cultivation technique on a total of 48 hectares (118.6 acres) in Punjab province. With the traditional method, in contrast, rice seedlings are first cultivated in nurseries for several weeks before being transferred to flooded fields. About a third more water is required through the growing cycle, and the crop takes 15 to 20 days longer to mature. On average in Pakistan, some 3,000 litres of water are used to produce 1 kilogramme of rice, which is the main staple food.But as the country's already scarce water resources dwindle, there is increasing pressure to find more water-efficient growing methods. A recent report from the Planning Commission of Pakistan shows that, in 1951, per-capita water availability was 5,650 cubic metres. By 2010, that figure had plunged to 1,000 cubic metres and is projected to fall to 800 cubic metres by 2025, when the population is expected to hit 221 million.Finding ways to grow more food with less water will be crucial in Pakistan as climate change alters weather patterns, affects monsoon rainfall and reduces groundwater, experts say.Planting rice directly in fields may be one way to keep up food production and help reduce the migration already happening as hard-hit, small-scale farmers give up on their fields and trek to towns and cities in search of other work.INNOVATION BENEFITSMuhammad, who grows rice on his family's 15 hectares (37 acres) in Sheikhupura district, said switching to the new planting method had cut the amount of irrigation needed in his rice fields by around 40 percent, a crucial change as groundwater levels drop.""This is really no small benefit,"" he said, smiling. ""This is helping us adapt to water shortages.""Muhammad learned the new technique under a four-year agricultural innovation programme, launched in 2013 by partners including the US Agency for International Development (USAID) and the International Rice Research Institute.The $30 million project aims to help Pakistan's farmers boost their profits while coping with climate change risks to the sustainability of water and agriculture, said John Groarke, head of USAID in Pakistan.Besides its work on rice, the programme has introduced heat-tolerant maize and higher-yielding wheat varieties, he added.Muhammad Ibrahim Mughal, chairman of Agri Forum Pakistan, a farmers' rights organisation, said traditional rice cultivation was time-consuming and laborious, as farmers spend long hours bent over in fields.It has also become less viable as river flows decrease and groundwater declines, he added.As a result, farmers are now increasingly willing to experiment with the new growing technique, said Sardar Karim, another farmer from Punjab province.Direct sowing is producing a 25 percent boost in harvests under ideal conditions on the test plots, said Iftikhar Ahmed, chairman of the Pakistan Agricultural Research Council.

This would likely be weighing down on commodity usage in China,"" Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore, said in a market commentary.""With weak Chinese industrial production, we may see Chinese manufacturing PMI worsen, thus, leading to weaker oil prices,"" he said, referring to the forward-looking Purchasing Managers´ Index to be released later this week.The market will also be on the lookout for economic data from the United States and the eurozone expected to be released this week.""Considering the expectations for both China and eurozone, we could see US being the tie breaker between oil bulls and bears. US data has not been exceptionally strong, and thus, could mean that oil prices could be facing some headwinds towards the end of the week,"" Ang said.In Asian trade, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for November delivery was down 10 cents to $47.16 and Brent crude for December fell 12 cents to $50.34 a barrel at around 0300 GMT.Both contracts fell for four straight trading days last week before advancing Friday on the back of data showing a fresh decline in US oil exploration, which suggested lower output that could help ease the global oversupply.Sanjeev Gupta, head of the Asia Pacific oil and gas practice at professional services firm EY, said the market will also be seeking clues from a meeting of OPEC and non-OPEC technical experts in Vienna on Wednesday.Oil-producer Russia said last week it was prepared to discuss output cuts during the meeting.

3546,asian stocks advance on china rate cut us tech earning,"TOKYO: Asian stocks on Monday were close to wiping out all their losses since China´s shock currency devaluation in August, as global equities rallied after the Chinese central bank cut rates and US tech giants provided upbeat earnings guidance.MSCI´s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan rose 0.5 percent to hit its highest since Aug. 12, led by 1.2 percent gains in Honk Kong. Japan´s Nikkei rose 1.1 percent to a two-month high.The surprise move by China lifted risk assets that had been already boosted by Thursday´s message from the European Central Bank that it stood ready to enhance quantitative easing and cut interest rates to even deeper negative levels.""These moves by the ECB and China are raising speculation that the Bank of Japan will act later on this week as well,"" Masahiro Ichikawa, senior strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management. The BOJ will hold its next policy review on Friday.The US Federal Reserve is also widely expected to refrain from raising rates at its two-day policy meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday.Against these backdrop, the MSCI's index of the world's share markets shot up to its highest level since Aug. 20, having risen more than 10 percent from its two-year low hit less than a month ago.It has recovered most of the losses since Aug. 11, when China's sudden devaluation of the yuan sparked worries its economy may be in deeper trouble than many had thought.On Wall Street, S&P 500 Index rose 1.1 percent to turn positive on the year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 2.3 percent.Technology shares led the way, thanks to gains in Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft, after the three companies reported earnings results. The former two hit record highs, while Microsoft rose to a 15-year high.Mainland Chinese shares rose on Monday after China cut the benchmark one-year lending rate - for the sixth time in less than a year - by 25 basis points to 4.35 percent, and lowered big banks' reserve requirement ratio late.Gains were fairly limited, however, with Shanghai composite index up just 0.5 percent.Naoki Tashiro, the president of TS China Research, noted that in the week following each of the past year's five rate mainland shares rose three times but fell twice.""Mainland investors are cautious. The market has been rallying so far this month, so some investors could may well take profits into rally,"" he said.One big focus is Chinese Communist party's central committee meeting from Monday to Thursday to set out a new five-year plan, while investors attempt to gauge how much China's growth is likely to slow in coming years.Ahead of the central committee meeting, Premier Li Keqiang said that China has never stated the economy must grow seven percent this year, coinciding with remarks by a top central bank official on Saturday that China would be able to keep annual economic growth at around 6-7 percent over that period.Risk sentiment supported by Thursday's message from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank stood ready to enhance quantitative easing.That saw the Italian and Spanish two-year government bond yields both turn negative for the first time, meaning investors effectively pay to hold them.The benchmark German two-year yield fell further to minus 0.345 percent.As negative yields undermine the attraction of holding the euro, traders pushed it to a 2 1/2-month low of $1.0989 in early Asian trade. It last stood at $1.1031, bouncing back on profit-taking.The yen dipped to 121.60 to the dollar, its lowest since late August as traders speculated the Bank of Japan might unleash additional easing on Friday, before bouncing back to 121.16 on profit-taking.""The Japanese economy is weaker than in August and there's no sign of a rebound. Markets are now expecting easing from the BOJ,"" said Takeru Ogihara, chief strategist at Mizuho Trust Bank.Despite a recovery in global equity prices, oil prices were softer, pressured by ongoing oversupply worries.Brent futures stood at $44.68, hardly recovering after a fall of 5.6 percent last week, not far from three-week low of $44.20 touched on Friday.

""Thanks to this agreement, Europe will also become the only region in the world which legally guarantees open internet and net neutrality,"" del Castillo told parliament in the eastern French city of Strasbourg.""The principle of net neutrality will be applied directly in the 28 member states. It also ensures that we will not have a two-speed internet,"" she said in a parliament statement.Critics said both measures were welcome but more should be done, especially on internet access.Monique Goyens, head of the European Consumer Organisation, said that while ""access to the open Internet is now a legal right for all EU consumers ... deficiencies remain.""

3551,rupee sinks to fresh two year low against dollar,"KARACHI: The Pakistani rupee on Wednesday slipped to a fresh two-year low of 105.80 against the US dollar in the interbank market, falling 56 paisa from its previous closing. In the open market, the rupee was down 30 paisa from Tuesday's closing, trading at 105.60 against the USD. Due to the rise in the value of the dollar by Rs 1.40 in the last two days, Pakistan's external debt is likely to see an increase of Rs 84 billion, analysts said. The recent climb of the dollar against the rupee has been attributed to a strong demand of the greenback from importers and its outflows from the country. Currency dealers say the growing demand is due to oil-related payments.""There were a few import payments in the market and banks were already short of them, and as the rupee crossed the 104.50 level it triggered 'stop', surging the rupee past the 105 figure,"" Eman Khan from Tresmark, an application that tracks financial markets, told The News on Tuesday.

3555,oil prices up in asia ahead of us crude inventories repor,"Singapore: Oil prices rebounded in Asia Tuesday, buoyed by bargain hunting ahead of the release of US government data that will gauge crude demand in the world´s biggest economy.Analysts expect the data to be released Wednesday by the US Energy Department to show that commercial crude stockpiles rose in the week to October 30 which typically means weaker demand in the world´s top oil consuming nation.Despite occasional rallies, oil remains generally bogged down by a global crude supply glut that has outpaced demand and depressed prices for more than a year.""Expectations of more US stockpiles restrained oil bulls,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.A global economic slowdown led by China has hammered demand for the commodity and highlighted worries that there may not be enough economic activity to soak up excess supplies as output levels from oil producing nations remain high.China´s official purchasing managers index for the manufacturing sector showed activity shrank in October for the third straight month.Russian oil production broke a post-Soviet record in October, climbing to 10.78 million barrels per day, according to Bloomberg News.At around 0310 GMT Tuesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was up 16 cents at $46.30 and Brent crude for December was trading 11 cents higher at $48.90 a barrel.Prices dipped on Monday after data showed China´s manufacturing output continued to contract and Russian oil production hit a new record high.Current price levels are more than 50 percent lower from their peaks in June 2014 when a barrel of oil was selling at over $100.

3559,moodys ups pakistan banking system outlook to stab,"LIMASSOL: Moodys Investors Service on Wednesday changed the outlook for the Pakistan banking system to stable from negative, reflecting the improvement in the countrys economic growth prospects, driven in turn by the governments commitment to economic reforms under its IMF program.We expect the strengthening economy, together with the central banks accommodative monetary policy, to stimulate lending growth and support the banking sectors loan performance over the next 12-18 months,"" said Elena Panayiotou, a Moodys Assistant Vice President and lead analyst for Pakistani banks.Moodys forecasts Pakistans real GDP will expand by 4.0 per cent in the fiscal year ending June 2016 (compared to a sluggish 2.8pc during 2008-13), mainly driven by higher spending on infrastructure projects as the government aims to ease energy shortages and execute projects associated with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC).The rating agency noted that the strengthening of the domestic economy will contribute to the improvement in Pakistani banks asset quality. The level of credit risk, however, will remain high as banks are heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign (B3, stable) through holdings of securities and government-related loans, which were equivalent in size to 7.3x Tier 1 capital, exposing banks to event risk.""We expect problem loans will decline to around 12 per cent of total loans by the end of 2016 compared with 12.4pc for the end of June 2015. Banks, however, will remain heavily exposed to the low-rated Pakistan sovereign, linking the banks creditworthiness to that of the sovereign"" Panayiotou said.In the area of capital, the rating agency expected that buffers will come under pressure due to moderate asset growth and lower internal capital generation  a result of weaker profitability.Moodys expected earnings to ease slightly over the outlook period, mainly because of the lower coupon on government securities in a declining interest rate environment and as the markets perception of Pakistans risk profile eases (upgraded to B3 from Caa1 on June 11, 2015). Higher loan volumes and capital gains booked through the sale of government securities will only partially offset the pressure on profitability.In addition, the rating agency expected that Pakistani banks will maintain ample liquidity and continue to benefit from large volumes of low-cost and stable customer deposits.""The Pakistani banks deposit-based funding structure remains a credit strength. We expect inflows of remittances from migrant workers will continue to drive the growth in bank deposits and support banks funding bases,"" said the asst vice-president of Moody's.While banks will use part of their liquid asset to fund lending, Moodys expected the sector to maintain strong liquidity buffers, with core liquid assets  defined as cash and bank placements  at 12 per cent of total assets and liquid securities, more broadly defined, at 41pc of total assets as of June 2015.

3560,oil prices resume decline in asi,"Singapore: Oil prices resumed their decline in Asia Wednesday, with global crude oversupply continuing to dampen investors´ sentiment despite occasional rallies.Prices had risen the previous day after a four-day losing streak, as traders weighed a bearish price outlook from the International Energy Agency (IEA) and a lowered US estimate for crude production.The oil market has collapsed by more than half since mid-2014 with prices languishing under $50 a barrel, hurt by the supply glut and the decision by the oil exporter grouping OPEC to maintain output to counter booming US shale production.The Paris-based IEA, in a report Tuesday, forecast that the global oil market would recover to $80 a barrel by 2020.At around 0300 GMT Wednesday, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in December was trading 47 cents lower at $43.74 and Brent crude for December was down 26 cents at $47.18.""We continue to think the market will remain in surplus through most of 2016, which is likely to restrict the upside for prices, particularly over the fourth quarter of 2015 and the first quarter of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said in a market commentary.A strong dollar, fuelled by widening expectations that the US Federal Reserve will raise interest rates next month, has also been keeping a lid on prices.Oil is traded in the US currency and a buoyant dollar would make the commodity more expensive for those holding weaker units, lowering demand and prices.""We expect the greenback to continue to be supported as we approach the likely lift-off in rates,"" Singapore´s United Overseas Bank said, referring to a December 17 meeting of the Fed´s policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee.

3561,oil prices under pressure in asi,"Singapore: Oil prices remained under pressure in Asia Friday after a huge jump in US crude inventories reinforced projections that a supply glut will persist well into next year.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in December was down 24 cents to $41.51 and Brent crude for December was trading four cents higher at $44.10 a barrel at around 0330 GMT.Prices were hammered Thursday after the US Department of Energy reported that commercial crude inventories in the world´s top oil consumer grew by 4.2 million barrels last week, far higher than analyst expectations of an increase of 1.3 million barrels.WTI sank 2.7 percent and Brent fell 3.8 percent after the report, which also showed US crude oil production continued to ramp higher.Global oil demand growth has not been fast enough to soak up the excess in supplies and analysts say a rebalancing of the supply-demand situation is needed for a sustained uptick in prices.Oil prices have plunged by more than half from peaks of over $100 a barrel in mid-2014.""Although global oil demand growth has been exceptionally strong year-to-date, the overall pace of supply side adjustment has been too slow to end a sustained increase in global inventories that we expect to persist through most of 2016,"" British bank Barclays said.It said in a market commentary that US offshore production in the Gulf of Mexico reached its highest level since early 2010 in August and is expected to remain strong although at a slower pace into 2016 ""as several more new fields begin to produce"".Members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) have also kept production high in an aggressive bid to retain market share.OPEC´s collective production has stabilised at around 31.5 million barrels per day in recent months, Barclays said, but this is still more than its output ceiling of 30 million barrels per day.

3562,asia markets down after paris attacks japan in recessi,"Hong Kong: Asian stock markets tumbled and the euro lost ground early Monday in the first trades after the deadly weekend terror attacks in Paris.The late-night assault on Friday in French capital, which killed 129 people, sparked concerns about security in Europe and its impact on the already struggling eurozone economy.It also sowed fresh uncertainty in already nervous markets, which ended last week on a low owing to increasing worries about the state of the global economy.Losses across Asian stock markets were joined by a fall in the euro, which is already under pressure from expectations the European Central Bank will loosen monetary policy to shore up the eurozone.""There is no doubt that the attacks in Paris will contribute to short-term investor nervousness,"" Shane Oliver, Sydney-based strategist at AMP Capital Investors, said.However, he added that he expected the Paris-linked losses to be brief and pointed out that markets had bounced back from initial selling following past terror attacks.""I think history will repeat itself. It will just be a short selloff in response to the Paris attacks,"" he told Bloomberg News.In early trade Hong Kong was 1.2 percent off, Tokyo fell one percent and Sydney gave up 0.9 percent.Adding to selling pressure in Tokyo Monday was data showing the Japanese economy had slipped into recession for the second time in three years, throwing into question the government´s much-vaunted drive to kickstart growth and inflation.- Shanghai retreats -The Cabinet Office said gross domestic product (GDP) shrank 0.2 percent in July-September, or 0.8 percent on an annualised basis, marking the second straight quarterly decline -- a technical recession.The preliminary figure was worse than the 0.1 percent decline forecast in a Bloomberg News survey and will put pressure on the Bank of Japan to ramp up its bond-buying scheme of monetary easing. The central bank is scheduled to hold a policy meeting this week.The soft results continue to flow despite Prime Minister Shinzo Abe´s big-spending three-year plan -- dubbed ""Abenomics"" -- to revitalise the torpid economy and end years of debilitating deflation.Taro Saito, director of economic research at NLI Research Institute, told AFP: ""Companies are reluctant to invest despite their sound profits."" He added that while consumer spending improved ""its overall trend still remains weak"".In China, authorities doubled the deposit required for investors to borrow funds to trade stocks -- known as margin trading -- as they try to limit a practice that led a massive market bubble and summer rout.The minimum requirement for margin trading was hiked to 100 percent from 50 percent, meaning traders must have the same level of funds in their accounts as the amount they want to borrow.Margin trading was behind a stock market rally that sent the Shanghai index up 150 percent in a year, before it crashed in June.The move comes as Shanghai rebounds from the summer volatility, with the benchmark index now up 22 percent from its August low. However, on Monday it was off 0.6 percent.

3567,sbp keeps policy rate unchanged at 6,"KARACHI:  State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) on Saturday announced its monetary policy and decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.A statement issued here said that the average Jul-Oct FY16 inflation was at 1.7 percent is lower than the 7.1 percent average inflation in the corresponding period of last year.It said that the decline is broad based as both food and non-food and core inflation measures came down in this period.Going forward with subdued outlook of international oil price and other major commodity prices and in the absence of any shock to supplies of food items even though the average inflation would remain below the FY16 annual target of 6 percent the headline inflation is expected to reverse its declining momentum.Moreover market surveys indicate a marginal increase in inflation expectations for the coming months.The SBP statement further pointed out that the current account deficit despite a year on year 10.6 percent contraction in exports has narrowed down to $ 532 million in Jul-Oct FY16 from $ 1.9billion in Jul-Oct FY15. The improvement largely owes to declining oil price that has substantially reduced the oil import payments healthy workers remittances and the realization of Coalition Support Fund.At the back of official disbursements and Eurobond inflows surplus in capital and financial account has supported the overall balance of payments position thus ensuring an upward trajectory in foreign exchange reserves in Jul Oct FY16. Going forward continued flow of external resources would be required to maintain the stable balance of payments position.Furthermore, realization of investment inflows stemming from the China Pakistan Economic Corridor would indeed strengthen the external sector outlook over the medium to long term.Large Scale Manufacturing (LSM) mainly supported by food and beverages, automobiles, fertilizers and cement production increased to 3.9 percent in Jul Sep 2015 compared to 2.6 percent in the same period of last year.Further boost to this growth is expected from expansion in cotton yarn manufacturing strong construction activities as per planned development spending increased automobile production encouraged by government schemes and improving energy supply at the back of recent LNG imports.Credit to private sector witnessed a nominal increase in July-October 2015 wherein fixed investments continued to expand for the fourth consecutive quarter from Q2 FY15 to Q1 FY16. As a result of easy monetary policy, the weighted average lending rates on fresh and outstanding loans at 7.8 percent and 9.2 percent in September2015 are the lowest in 10 years.Thus, with current credit cycle now entering in uptake phase and with improving LSM growth borrowing on account of both the working capital and fixed investment is likely to increase.This outlook would reflect in broad money (M2) growth going forward which during July 01-November 06, 2015 M2 has expanded by 0.2percent against 0.7 percent during the same period last year.While the Net Domestic Assets declined by Rs 78 billion Net Foreign Assets contribution in M2 growth remained substantial as it increased by Rs106 billion.In view of the foregoing the Central Board of Directors of SBP has decided to keep the policy rate unchanged at 6.0 percent.

Although the government has taken a bold decision of daring traders community, the constituency of the ruling party, the current scheme lacks any strategy for checking the smuggled items that are available at cheap rates but without any invoicing, generating a chain of undocumented income and tax evasion at multiple level.It is hard to fix all issues at once but we are trying to raise the cost of undocumented business through taxing banking transactions, said an official privy to the ongoing deliberations when asked about the challenges to economy from the smuggled goods.Instead, the government is more focused on bringing the traders into the tax net by exempting them from tax audit at least for three-year allowing them declare their hidden assets and bank accounts, and in return they will gradually increase their tax payments during the amnesty period.We have reminded traders that the era of benami transactions is going to be over soon, said a tax official with reference to the legislation being drafted for tabling in Parliament early next year suggesting heavy penalty for offenders.The government will grant amnesty to the traders having undeclared assets if the declarations are made in the tax return and such return filers continue increasing their tax payment by 25% during the financial years exempted from scrutiny.Unlike the complicated tax return form for the regular taxpayers, one-page tax return is being designed for the traders in English and Urdu both benefiting from this scheme in order to facilitate their entry into the tax net.Another issue regarding the sales tax on the turnover is also being reduced from one percent to 0.25% in order to settle down long-standing dispute between the FBR and the traders. The traders have been objecting turnover on the total cost of product instead of total sale.Among other measures to address their concerns, regional-level committees of traders have been formed for meetings with the regional tax commissioners to discuss ways and means for ironing out differences.Right now, the government is in contact with two groups of traders headed by Khalid Pervez and Naeem Mir, both are Lahore-based.The former is said to be non-cooperative as he tends to politicise the entire issues even the tax notices that he received months ago alleging him of mis-declaration of bank accounts and assets.In tax year 2013, he declared a book shop in Urdu Bazara as his only business in addition to foreign remittances of four millions rupees and property income of three millions and paid tax Rs49,992, according to an FBR official. This was in contrast with the six undeclared bank accounts and plots as well as eight vehicles spotted by the FBR forming basis of issuing him a notice.Naeem Mir, on the other hand, has been cooperative and urging the government to launch an awareness campaign in order to counter the false propaganda, address their legitimate concerns in addition to educating traders about the benefits of being in the tax net.

3571,oil prices down on diplomatic efforts to ease middle east tensi,"Singapore: Oil prices fell in Asia Wednesday as diplomats tried to ease geopolitical tensions sparked by Turkey´s shooting down of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.Prices had surged Tuesday following the incident which analysts warned could further heighten tensions among key powers involved in the Syrian conflict and affect crude supplies from the oil-producing Middle East.The rally was cut short amid a flurry of diplomatic effort to appease a furious Russian President Vladimir Putin who called the shooting a ""stab in the back"" by ""accomplices of terrorists"".UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for urgent measures to cool down the heat, saying a ""credible and thorough review"" of the incident would help clarify what happened and prevent a repeat.The Russian SU-24 attack plane was shot down earlier Tuesday by two Turkish F-16s after it received 10 warnings within a five-minute period, Turkey´s envoy to the United Nations said, but Moscow insisted the aircraft was inside Syrian territory.At around 0215 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was down 11 cents to $42.76 and Brent crude for January was trading seven cents lower at $46.05. Both contracts jumped by more than $1 after the shooting.""Crude prices were bid up on fresh concerns over the Middle East tensions after Turkey shot down a Russian aircraft,"" said Bernard Aw, market strategist at IG Markets in Singapore.""However, it is unlikely that the tensions will escalate given the trade importance between the two countries, which means we should see a diplomatic solution,"" he told AFP.He said traders are setting their sights on a meeting on December 4 of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries for signs on whether the cartel will slash high production levels which have depressed prices in an oversupplied market.""An agreement to cut the production target will definitely be a booster for oil prices,"" Aw said.Attention will also be on a report by the US Department of Energy later Wednesday on last week´s commercial crude stockpiles that will gauge demand in the world´s top oil consumer.

3576,oil prices up in asi,"Singapore: Oil prices held above $43 a barrel in Asia Thursday after US commercial crude supplies rose at a slower pace while jitters over the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian warplane lingered.Data from the US Department of Energy released Wednesday showed the country´s commercial crude supplies rose by 1.0 million barrels for the week ending November 20.The increase for a ninth straight week kept supplies more than 100 million barrels above the five-year seasonal average and further confirmed the supply glut that has depressed prices for over a year.However, analysts noted that the increase was not as much as in previous rises and could be positive for prices in the longer term.The inventories data was followed by a report from oil field services firm Baker Hughes showing US oil drilling rigs in operation fell by nine to 555, indicating an ease in activities.""US crude oil inventories are not increasing as much as before, so this is giving the market some bullish sentiment,"" said Daniel Ang, an investment analyst with Phillip Futures in Singapore.At around 0115 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for delivery in January was up eight cents at $43.12 and Brent crude for January was trading seven cents higher at $46.24.Ang said a report that durable goods orders in the United States, a barometer of the health of the world´s biggest economy, came in better than expected was also helping to perk up sentiment.Prices rose after Turkey downed a Russian warplane on the Syrian border on Tuesday, due to fears that any escalation of the conflict would affect crude supplies.""There are still tensions going on and they are giving a bullish push to prices,"" Ang said. ""Tensions are still playing a part in the whole oil landscape.""Russia on Wednesday accused Turkey of a ""planned provocation"" and a rescued pilot of the targeted jet said that no warning had been given.

3577,oil prices gain ahead of opec meeting,"London: World oil prices rose this week on concerns that heightened geopolitical tensions could disrupt Middle East supplies despite a market awash with crude.Traders were turning their attention to next week´s OPEC output meeting to see if the oil producers´ cartel will slash high output levels.The 12-nation OPEC, which counts the world´s biggest oil producer Saudi Arabia among its members as well as Nigeria, Venezuela and Iran, holds a regular meeting in Vienna on December 4.Most analysts expect the cartel to stick to its decision taken at the last meeting in June, when OPEC defied calls to cut output despite sliding oil prices, so extending its strategy of preserving market share and fending off competition from the US shale energy boom.Keeping the status quo would see the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries´ official production target left at 30 million barrels per day -- where it has stood for four years -- following pressure from cartel kingpin Saudi Arabia on the other members.""We continue to believe that there will not be any change in Saudi or OPEC policy"" in Vienna, noted Societe Generale analyst Michael Wittner.""Oil market oversupply will continue through next year, due to resilient US production -- even if it is declining -- high OPEC output led by Saudi Arabia and Iraq and the gradual return of Iran starting in"" 2016, he added.OPEC member Iran last week said it would not negotiate with the cartel over a planned half million barrels per day oil production hike once sanctions are lifted.Despite a supply glut that has caused crude prices to more than halve over the past 18 months -- due primarily to high output from US shale rock but also owing to weaker Chinese demand -- Iran has consistently said it plans to up its output when nuclear-related sanctions are lifted under a deal agreed in July with world powers.Downward pressure on the oil market this week was meanwhile capped by the shooting down by Turkey of a Russian fighter jet on the Syrian border.But reports that Russia is not taking military action against Turkey in retaliation eased fears that the tense situation in the region could escalate and disrupt Middle East oil supplies.Moscow said retaliatory measures would focus on using its leverage to tighten the screws on Turkey´s economy, including halting joint economic projects.Next week will see traders monitoring also the meeting of the Federal Reserve, when policymakers are expected to lift US interest rates for the first time in almost a decade. A hike would likely boost the dollar, making oil priced in the US unit more expensive for holders of weaker currencies.By late Friday in London, Brent North Sea crude for delivery in January edged higher to $44.93 a barrel from $44.66 a barrel one week earlier.US benchmark West Texas Intermediate for January stood at $42.02 a barrel compared with $40.39 for the expired December contract one week earlier.

3578,pakistan aims to raise 379 million in new taxes to meet imf targ,"ISLAMABAD: Pakistan must raise an extra $379 million (about Rs40 billion) through new tax measures, the finance minister said on Monday, as the government seeks to qualify for its latest IMF loan tranche.Earlier this month, the IMF approved the release in December of a $502 million tranche of Pakistan´s three-year $6.68 billion programme, even though the government missed targets for tax revenue generation, net domestic assets and the budget deficit.The government will levy an additional 5 to 10 percentage points of tax on 350 items and raise customs duty by 1 percentage point, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said at a press conference in the federal capital.The full list of items was not immediately available.The increased levies would target ""non-essential luxury items"" only, and exemptions on the customs duty have been offered for 25 key industrial sectors, Dar said on Monday.""We have kept in mind not to increase duties that would make items more expensive for the common man,"" he said.Separate increased taxes were also announced on imported automobiles - both new and used - and domestically-produced cigarettes.In its last review, the International Monetary Fund had warned that the release of December´s approved $502 million tranche depended on the announcement of new measures to generate an extra 40 billion Pakistan rupees ($380 million) in revenue. ""This was a deadline in a sense, and if the government didn´t do it the next tranche of the programme would at least be delayed, if not suspended,"" Khurram Husain, an economic analyst and journalist, told Reuters.It was unclear if the new measures would meet the target.Dar had earlier told a parliamentary standing committee that the increased duties were meant to restrict Pakistan´s import bill, not increase revenue.Husain said if the measures did not raise enough funds, the government would have to raise taxes on staples such as electricity and petrol.

3587,Oil gain fails to halt fresh slide on Asian mar,"Hong Kong: A modest recovery in oil prices provided some respite for Asian energy firms Wednesday but stock markets extended losses as China´s ongoing economic woes cast a pall over the region´s trading floors.The cost of the black gold has plunged by almost a tenth since Friday´s refusal by the OPEC oil exporters´ group to agree a ceiling on output despite oversupply and anaemic demand across the globe.The impact of the weak commodity price environment was also made stark Tuesday when US mining giant Anglo American said it would scythe almost two-thirds of its workforce and reduce investment by about $1 billion.On Wednesday US benchmark West Texas Intermediate was up 1.7 percent in the morning while Brent added 1.2 percent.Among regional energy firms BHP Billiton added almost one percent in Sydney, Inpex gained 1.3 percent in Tokyo and Hong Kong-listed CNOOC put on 1.7 percent.However, the oil contracts are still struggling around seven-year lows and analysts said the gloom was likely to last for some time.""We remain of the view that oil will stay below $50 a barrel into the foreseeable future,"" Evan Lucas, a markets strategist in Melbourne at IG Ltd., told clients according to Bloomberg News.""The industrial metals and iron-ore thematics are basically facing the same factors that are influencing oil.""A global supply glut, weak demand and the growth slowdown in China have combined with soaring production to send crude slumping more than 60 percent over the past 18 months.Most Asian markets extended their losses of this week, tracking a downturn on Wall Street where all three main indexes ended in the red.Tokyo was 1.1 percent off by lunch, Hong Kong lost 0.6 percent and Sydney fell 0.3 percent while Taipei, Singapore and Kuala Lumpur were also in negative territory.Shanghai was 0.2 percent down as ongoing worries about China overshadowed data showing November inflation was just above expectations.Consumer prices rose 1.5 percent last month, up from October and better than the forecast in a survey by Bloomberg News but well short of Beijing´s target rate of ""around three percent"".But the November reading remained well below China´s annual target of an increase of ""around three percent"" announced in March.- Key figures around 0300 GMT -Tokyo - Nikkei 225: DOWN 1.1 percent at 19,281.46 (break)Hong Kong - Hang Seng: DOWN 0.5 percent at 21803.28Euro/dollar: UP to $1.0912 from $1.0892 late TuesdayDollar/yen: DOWN to 122.78 yen from 122.97 yenNew York - Dow: DOWN 0.9 percent at 17,568.00 (close)London - FTSE 100: DOWN 1.4 percent at 6,135.22 points (close)",2015-12-09,0.26666666666666666,-0.06666666666666667,0.39901960784313734,-0.04901960784313727

The metal got a boost on Monday as the dollar fell after data from the Chicago Federal Reserve suggested the U.S. economy grew at a below average pace in November.""The jump in gold-ETF demand is impressive after the string of losses over the past couple of years, but the market will likely need to see further accumulation for the rally to be extended,"" said HSBC analyst James Steel.""A major stumbling block for a further gold rally is oil, and commodity prices in general,"" he said, adding that oil is a powerful drag on gold.Crude oil slid to its lowest levels since 2004 on Monday and more declines could ignite deflation fears. Bullion is often seen as a hedge against oil-led inflation.SPDR Gold Trust, the world's top gold ETF, saw its assets rise by nearly 19 tonnes on Friday, the first increase in two months and the biggest in four years.

The Fed last week raised U.S. interest rates for the first time in nearly a decade. Investors fear higher rates could dent demand for non-interest-paying gold, while boosting the dollar.The Fed's promise of gradual rate hikes in coming months means the central bank will not raise rates at every meeting, Atlanta Fed President Dennis Lockhart said on Monday.

3617,Oil slides to new 11 year low over Saudi Iran r,"LONDON: Oil prices slid more than 4 percent to new 11-year lows on Wednesday as the row between Saudi Arabia and Iran made any cooperation between major exporters to cut output even more unlikely.The furore over Saudi Arabia´s execution of a Shi´ite cleric has stripped nearly 8 percent off the price of oil in the last three trading days, killing speculation that OPEC members might agree to production cuts to lift prices.""There are rising stockpiles and the tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia make any deal on production unlikely,"" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets.Evidence of slowing economic growth in China and India has meanwhile fuelled fears that even strong demand elsewhere may not be enough to mop up the excess crude that has resulted from near-record production over the last year.Benchmark Brent crude futures were at $35.07 a barrel at 1318 GMT, down $1.58 on the day, and reached their lowest since early July 2004, having staged their largest one-day drop in percentage terms in nearly five weeks.US crude futures were down $1.25 cents at $34.72 a barrel after slipping 79 cents the previous day.Oil has slumped from above $115 in June 2014 as shale oil from the United States has flooded the market, while falling prices have prompted some producers to pump even harder to compensate for lower revenues and to keep market share.Adding to this oversupply, Iranian oil exports are widely expected to increase in 2016 as Western sanctions against Tehran over its nuclear programme are lifted.""Shale production and increasing capacity from countries like Russia who need to protect revenue combined with expectations of further Iranian supply mean actual production as well as expectations of future production are rising,"" Hewson said.Still, a senior Iranian oil official said the country could moderate oil export increases once sanctions are lifted to avoid putting prices under further pressure.Also feeding into broad market weakness, a survey showed that China´s services sector expanded at its slowest pace in 17 months in December, following on from weak factory data on Monday which also knocked markets globally.The People´s Bank of China set a weaker midpoint for the yuan, prompting concerns that the economy of the world´s largest energy consumer could be in worse shape than<br/>believed.In the United States, concerns over mounting oil stock levels persisted, with crude inventories likely to have risen by 439,000 barrels last week, according to a Reuters poll of eight analysts.The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) will publish its closely watched weekly data at 1530 GMT.Some analysts think oil prices have fallen too far and will stage a sharp recovery later in the year, with Commerzbank targeting $60 per barrel by the end of 2016.""This looks ambitious from current levels but current prices are unsustainably low,"" Carsten Fritsch, senior oil analyst at Commerzbank, told the Global Oil Forum.""We are in a speculative exaggeration at the moment.""He added that he expects US oil production to fall at least 1 million bpd by autumn. ",2016-01-06,0.37727272727272726,0.06818181818181818,0.4300505050505049,-0.06620827843653931

3619,Saudi Iran split dashes chance of OPEC deal to curb oil glu,"LONDON: The collapse in relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran after the Saudi execution of a Shi´ite cleric puts an end to speculation that OPEC could somehow agree production curbs to lift the price of oil anytime soon.A Reuters survey of OPEC production showed on Tuesday that Saudi Arabia ended 2015 with its output at full tilt, with no sign of cutting supply to make room for Iran, which plans to ramp up its own output when international financial sanctions are lifted this year.According to the survey, compiled from shipping data, oil company figures and industry experts, Saudi production for December averaged 10.15 million barrels per day.That means it was above 10 million barrels per day for nine straight months, the longest period of sustained production above that threshold for decades.The determination by the world´s biggest exporter Saudi Arabia to defend its market share despite a global glut has helped drive oil prices to their lowest in 11 years.Meanwhile, the lifting of sanctions on Iran in line with a nuclear agreement is expected to provide the biggest increase in supply of 2016. The world is now producing 1.5 million barrels a day more than it is consuming, and Iran is promising to add another million bpd to supply over the next 12 months.The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to agree any caps on production at its annual meeting in Vienna last month, amid acrimony between Saudi Arabia and Iran, the Gulf region´s main Sunni and Shi´ite powers.If there was still any suggestion that the two rivals might somehow overcome their animosity to agree to manage supply this year, it was buried on Monday when Riyadh called off diplomatic ties with Tehran over Iran´s response to the execution of Saudi<br/>Shi´ite cleric Nimr al-Nimr.Several OPEC delegates told Reuters they now saw no chance of any improvement in relations between OPEC members, which have been already very low over the past months.<br/><br/>""This new situation will just make it worse and I see no agreement to be reached within OPEC,"" one representative to OPEC from a member country outside the Gulf region said, on condition of anonymity.",2016-01-06,0.0,0.0,0.3283116883116882,0.014430014430014433

In June it had forecast 0.7 percent GDP growth for 2016. The bank estimates the Russian economy shrank by 3.8 percent in 2015.In Brazil, GDP is forecast to decline by 2.5 percent in 2016 compared with an earlier estimate for growth of 1.1 percent, the World Bank said. The Brazilian economy likely contracted at a 3.7 percent rate in 2015.China GDP growth was estimated to slow to 6.7 percent in 2016 from an estimated 6.9 percent in 2015. In June the bank had estimated 2016 growth of 7.0 percent.The South African economy should grow at a modestly faster rate in 2016 than last year - 1.4 percent compared with 1.3 percent - but substantially slower than the 2.1 percent growth forecast in June.Of that group, India was the only one expected to see notable improvement in economic performance from 2015 - advancing at a 7.8 percent rate in 2016 versus 7.3 percent in 2015. But even there, the bank nipped its 2016 estimate by 0.1 percentage point from its earlier forecast.The bank also trimmed its outlook for the United States and other developed economies.The U.S. economy should grow by 2.7 percent, down from an earlier estimate of 2.8 percent but up from 2015's 2.5 percent.Estimates for growth in the euro zone were trimmed by the same amount, to 1.7 percent from 1.8 percent previously, although that would mark a modest acceleration from 2015's estimated 1.5 percent rate.",2016-01-07,0.1,0.1,0.3450617283950618,0.03375771604938271

Trading on its stock markets was suspended for the rest of the day.Global oil prices have crashed 70 percent since mid-2014 as near record output from major producers like the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and North America create a ballooning overhang that has left storage tanks around the world struggling to cope with the excess oil.At the same time, demand is slowing, especially in Asia where the biggest economy and energy consumer, China, is seeing the slowest economic growth in a generation.Global benchmark Brent crude futures fell to new 11-year lows of $33.09 per barrel on Thursday, undercutting a low from a day earlier, although prices edged back to $33.52 per barrel by 0213 GMT.Traders said a dispute between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which might normally be seen as posing a risk to oil supplies, may actually be bearish as it all but eliminates cooperation over production between the two OPEC members.""Neither one of them (Saudi Arabia or Iran) is going to voluntarily cede a single barrel to the other, so it arguably makes a coordinated production cut even less likely than it has been,"" one Middle East oil trader said.In the United States, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures set fresh 2009 lows of $32.77 per barrel, with prices crawling back to $33.25 by 0213 GMT.Analysts said that the huge U.S. storage overhang was the main reason for falling WTI crude.""Data suggest gasoline and distillate fuel stockpiles increased 10.6 million barrels and 6.3 million barrels, respectively, last week.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected exports to fall 8.0 percent and imports to fall 11.5 percent.While investors harbour suspicions about the reliability of the data, on the surface they offered hope that world trade flows were at least stabilising after a dismal 2015.It also suggested Beijing might prove successful in its increasingly forceful attempts to stabilise the yuan, so dampening fears of a sustained devaluation.All of which galvanised currency markets where the Australian dollar, often used as a liquid proxy for the yuan, was up half a U.S. cent at $0.7036.With safe-haven suddenly out of favour, the Japanese yen and the euro eased broadly.

However, meteorological data in Reuters shows that the current cold snaps will likely to be short-lived.The cold weather in North America and Europe follows an extremely mild start to the winter in large parts of the northern hemisphere that had led to weaker-than-usual demand for oil, exacerbating a plunge in prices earlier this year.Traders said that a lot of people with open short positions in the market, which profit from falling prices, had decided to cash in when prices plunged 30 percent between the beginning of the year and the middle of this week. They have now flipped into buying at low costs, lifting oil futures.""More stable global markets are likely to see speculative buying re-emerge in commodities that have suffered heavy losses in recent weeks. However, these rallies are likely to remain short-lived,"" ANZ bank said.Analysts said the fundamental reason for low oil prices remained unchanged, with producers around the world pumping over 1 million barrels of crude every day beyond demand, leaving storage tanks brimming.US crude inventories rose 4 million barrels in the last week, compared with analyst expectations for an increase of 2.8 million barrels, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA).""At 486.5 million barrels, US crude oil inventories remain near levels not seen for this time of year in at least the last 80 years,"" the EIA said.",2016-01-22,0.5,-0.3,0.5157375145180022,-0.0781068524970964

The S&amp;P energy sector surged 4.3 percent.Both the Federal Reserve and Bank of Japan hold policy meetings this week, with the Fed meeting on Jan. 26-27 and the BOJ meeting immediately after, on Jan. 28-29.Investors will look for any hints of when the Fed intends to make a second interest rate hike, while there is speculation that the BOJ could opt to take additional easing measures.""We expect no action from the Fed or BOJ, although investors will be looking for a more dovish forward bias as the renewed decline in oil prices lowers inflation expectations globally,"" wrote strategists at Barclays.Risk aversion amid fears of a China-led global slowdown and oil prices sinking to 13-year lows had rocked global markets at the start of the year, and the lull in flight-to-quality seen towards the end of last week weighed on safe havens like U.S. Treasuries and the Japanese yen.The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield US10YT=RR nudged up to 2.05 percent after rising to as high as 2.089 percent on Friday, the highest in a week.The dollar was steady at 118.795 yen after surging 0.9 percent on Friday, when it touched a two-week high of 118.88. The euro was little changed at $1.0801 after losing 0.8 percent on Friday.The Australian dollar, sensitive to the ebb and flow in risk appetite and fluctuations in commodity prices, traded at $0.7002 after touching a nine-day high of $0.7046 on Friday.Crude, recently under pressure from a global glut, jumped percent as harsh winter weather on the U.S. East coast boosted demand for heating oil. U.S. crude climbed 9 percent and Brent LCOc1 bounced 10 percent on Friday.U.S. crude was last up 0.3 percent at $32.29 a barrel.

While Brent crude was off 23 cents at $32.87 a barrel, this followed a 4 percent jump on Wednesday after Russia hinted at co-operation with OPEC on oversupply.U.S. crude eased back 21 cents to $32.09.After starting weaker, MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan swung 0.4 percent firmer in very choppy trade.Likewise, Japan's Nikkei turned 0.3 percent higher having been down more than 1 percent at one stage. Shanghai's Composite Index was just a whisker lower.The initial losses followed a poor finish on Wall Street, though dealers noted E-Mini futures for the S&amp;P 500 had since rebounded by 0.65 percent.The Dow had ended Wednesday with losses of 1.38 percent, while the S&amp;P 500 fell 1.09 percent and the Nasdaq shed 2.18 percent.Apple's shares fell 6.57 percent after the iPhone maker reported its slowest-ever rise in shipments, while Boeing lost 8.9 percent in its biggest fall since August 2011.The blame for Wall Street's fall was laid at the door of the Federal Reserve, with investors apparently frustrated the central bank was not concerned enough about the global outlook to scale back its plans for policy tightening.Rather, the Fed left all options open, including a hike at the next meeting in March.""We have no doubt that the market was looking for a 'Fed put' via some commentary about the committee growing increasingly nervous about financial markets and the global backdrop,"" wrote Tom Porcelli, chief U.S. economist at RBCCM.""Instead, the Fed chose the pragmatic route.""The reaction to the Fed in currency markets was much more muted.

3657,IEA sees global oil glut worsening OPEC deal unlikely,"strong>LONDON: The world will store unwanted oil for most of 2016 as declines in U.S. output take time and OPEC is unlikely to cut a deal with other producers to reduce ballooning output, the International Energy Agency said.</strongThe agency, which coordinates energy policies of industrialised countries, said that while it did not believe oil prices could follow some of the most extreme forecasts and fall to as low as $10 per barrel, it was equally hard to see how they could rise significantly from current levels.The Paris-based IEA trimmed its forecast for 2016 oil demand growth, which now stands at 1.17 million barrels per day (bpd) following a five-year high of 1.6 million in 2015.It cut its call on OPEC crude for 2016 by 100,000 bpd to 31.7 million bpd. That figure is much lower than OPEC's January output of 32.63 million bpd.""Persistent speculation about a deal between OPEC and leading non-OPEC producers to cut output appears to be just that: speculation. It is OPEC's business whether or not it makes output cuts either alone or in concert with other producers but the likelihood of coordinated cuts is very low,"" the IEA said.Oil prices collapsed over the past 18 months to below $30 a barrel from as high as $115 as OPEC opened its taps to drive higher-cost producers such as U.S. shale companies out of the market.Low oil prices have spurred global demand but it was not enough to absorb all crude produced. As a result, unwanted oil went into storage, leading to record global stockpiles of over 3 billion barrels.U.S. shale oil output has started to decline because of low prices and OPEC has said it sees the market rebalancing sometime later in 2016 when demand finally meets supply.But the IEA said supply may still exceed demand throughout the whole of 2016 and added it saw non-OPEC output falling by just 0.6 million bpd in 2016.""The number could be higher of course and many senior international oil company figures have said so but there is a lingering feeling that the big fall-off in production from U.S. shale producers is taking an awful long time to happen. Perhaps resilience still has some way to go,"" the IEA said.The agency also said it saw the dollar remaining strong as it benefits from its safe-haven status, meaning more downward pressure on oil prices.With weaker global oil demand, likely new gains in Iraqi, Iranian and Saudi output, low chances of an OPEC deal, resilient U.S. production and a strong dollar - the IEA said the global oil glut was only poised to worsen.It said that even if OPEC production remained flat, global stocks would build by 2 million bpd in the first quarter, followed by a 1.5-million-bpd build in the second quarter.""Supply and demand data for the second half of the year suggests more stock building, this time by 0.3 million bpd. If these numbers prove to be accurate, and with the market already awash in oil, it is very hard to see how oil prices can rise significantly in the short term. In these conditions the short-term risk to the downside has increased.",2016-02-09,0.25,-0.25,0.432931675242996,0.027085477415666095

Solid U.S. data is also improving investor sentiment given that they are counting on U.S. growth to lead the global economy,"" said Hirokazu Kabeya, chief global strategist at Daiwa Securities.U.S. retail sales data published on Friday showing firm growth allayed fears - at least for now - that the U.S. economy could be dragged into recession as growth stumbles in many parts of the world.Sentiment on the U.S. currency also improved, with the dollar rising to 114.65 yen, recovering further from a 15-month low of 110.985 touched on Thursday.The euro also eased to as low as $1.1128 on Monday, retreating from Thursday's 3 1/2-month high of $1.1377, and last stood at $1.1173.The common currency was also driven lower by remarks from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi that the bank is ready to ease policy further in March.Gold extended fall from Thursday's one-year peak of $1,262.90 per ounce as safe-haven buying in the precious metal in recent weeks was rolled back.It fell 0.6 percent to $1,203.90, unable to find a floor after 2.2 percent on Monday, which was its biggest fall in almost seven months.Oil prices gained on news of a rare private meeting of top officials from the world's biggest oil producers spurred speculation of an eventual deal to tackle a deep supply glut.Global benchmark Brent futures rose 3.3 percent to $34.48 a barrel, rising to their highest level in a week. U.S. crude futures also jumped back above $30.As risk sentiment improved, yields on top-rated government bond rose, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield rising 4.7 basis points to 1.793 percent from 1.746 percent at the end of last week.The Bank of Japan started implementing negative interest rates on Tuesday. The benchmark interbank lending rate fell to zero percent but not to negative levels partly because some banks have not fixed their system to deal with negative rates.",2016-02-16,0.0,0.0,0.3502830188679244,0.05301886792452832

""We have repeatedly said that Iran will increase its crude output until reaching the pre-sanctions<br/>production level.""The freeze plan has so far failed to push up oil prices, due to concerns Iran would not participate and that a deal would do little to ease the global glut as it would still allow Russia and Saudi Arabia to keep pumping at near record levels.Venezuelan Oil Minister Eulogio Del Pino, Iraqi Oil Minister Adel Abdel Mahdi and Qatari Energy Minister Mohammad bin Saleh al-Sada sat down with Zanganeh at 3 p.<br/>m. (1130 GMT).The sanctions, imposed over Iran´s nuclear programme, were lifted last month after an agreement with world powers, allowing Tehran to resume selling oil freely in international markets.Iran exported around 2.5 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude before 2012, but sanctions cut that to around 1.1 million bpd.Tehran has pledged to raise supply by around 1 million bpd in the next 6-12 months.",2016-02-17,0.0,0.0,0.35821759259259256,-0.05752314814814815

US crude futures were down 1.8 percent at $31.29 per barrel, while international benchmark Brent futures were down 1 percent at $32.94.""I suspect few people were expecting a deal to cut production so his comments are hardly a surprise. Yet, the latest development seems to suggest that for oil producers to get more united they will have to feel more pain,"" said Ayako Sera, senior market economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Bank.The toll from low oil prices is also spreading to banks that have exposure to the energy sector, as roughly a third of US shale oil producers are at high risk of slipping into bankruptcy this year, according to a study by Deloitte.JP Morgan, the largest US bank by assets, said it will increase provisions for expected losses on energy loans by $500 million, or more than 60 percent of its existing reserves.JPMorgan shares fell 4.2 percent on the announcement.Investors instead favoured safer assets such as US Treasuries, with the 10-year notes yield falling to a two-week low of 1.714 percent overnight.The increased risk aversion led gold to erase all its losses from earlier this week to trade at $1,227.30 per ounce, coming near its one-year high of $1,262.90 touched about two weeks ago.In the currency market, traditional safe-haven currencies such as the yen and the Swiss franc outperformed.The yen firmed to 111.77 to the dollar on Tuesday, edging near its 15-month high of 110.985 hit on Feb. 11.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 21 cents at $32.86.""Capping production at January levels, when the market was pumping out well over a million barrels of crude a day above what consumers need, will in no way reduce overcapacity. In fact, given that Iran has started to return to markets since January, it'll worsen the glut,"" said one senior oil trader.Iran is hoping to increase its crude exports by 1 million barrels per day within the next year after international sanctions against it were lifted in January. The sanctions had cut Iran's exports by more than half from a pre-sanctions peak of almost 3 million barrels per day in 2011.Despite the glut, prices did receive some support this week from strong demand for gasoline, especially in the United States.""The idea that gasoline demand is actually rising suggests that perhaps the lower prices of crude are actually prompting a greater usage of this product (gasoline),"" said Vyanne Lai, oil analyst at National Australia Bank.""I think the market is reading this as a positive sign in terms of demand.""",2016-02-26,0.0,0.0,0.5040246212121211,-0.11060606060606061

3685,Asian shares slip after G20 Fed ang,"strong>TOKYO: Asian stocks retreated on Monday after a weekend meeting of G20 policymakers ended with no new coordinated action to spur global growth and as solid US data revived expectation of the Federal Reserve further raising rates before year-end.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.4 percent and appeared likely to post its second consecutive month of losses, with a 1.0 percent drop so far this month.Japan's Nikkei gained 0.4 percent largely on the overnight fall in the yen, though it looks set to log its third monthly fall in a row with decline of 7.2 percent so far.Mainland Chinese shares fell sharply with the bluechip CSI 300 Index briefly hitting a 15-month low.Disappointing earnings results released over the weekend, the lack of concrete measures from the group of 20 economies and political implications from the latest cyberspace crackdown by Beijing were all cited as a culprit.G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to use ""all policy tools  monetary, fiscal and structural  individually and collectively"" to reach the group's economic goals, citing a series of risks to world growth.""The G20 communique basically says 1) the world is not as bad a place as markets think; and 2) if it gets worse we will use fiscal, monetary and structural policy aggressively to fix it,"" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX Strategy at CitiFX, said in a note to clients.""In baseball parlance, they were aiming for a single in terms of restoring confidence and they probably achieved it,"" he added.While some market players say the statement could mildly underpin market sentiment, the lack of any concrete action - especially on fiscal stimulus as some had speculated - was seen as a disappointment.A pledge in the statement to ""consult closely"" on foreign exchange markets was also seen by some market players as hindering a few countries from adopting flexible policy actions.On the other hand, fresh US economic data published on Friday revived expectations of Federal Reserve rate increases, helping to lift US bond yields and the dollar.Consumer spending rose solidly in January and underlying inflation picked up by the most in four years. Gross domestic product growth in the fourth quarter was revised higher, to a 1.0 percent annual rate""The US economy doesn't look too bad after all. So some people seem to start thinking that the Fed's rate hike could be back on the agenda,"" said Bart Wakabayashi, head of forex at State Street.The figures prompted Federal funds rate futures to price in a more than 50 percent chance of one rate hike by the end of year, compared to almost zero percent chance in mid-February.The two-year US Treasuries yield also hit a four-week high of 0.817 percent on Friday and last stood at 0.797 percent versus its Feb 11 low of 0.582 percent.The greenback's yield allure helped lift the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies to a three-week high of 98.26 on Friday. It last stood at 98.13.As the dollar gained, the euro fetched $1.0920, having slipped to a three-week low of $1.0912 on Friday. In early Asia on Monday, it traded at $1.0931, flat on the day.The yen also slipped to one-week low of 114 to the dollar on Friday but bounced back 0.5 percent on Monday to 113.41.Still, with gains of 6.8 percent in February, the yen remains the best performing major currency this month as concerns over slowing global growth fanned buying in safe-haven assets.In contrast, fears of ""Brexit"" offered traders a good excuse to sell the British pound, which fell to a seven-year low of $1.3841.Although the British government managed to get G20 to agree to include a warning against ""Brexit"" in the statement, that appeared to have limited impact. The British currency is down 2.7 percent on month.Equally under pressure was the South Korean won, which fell to 5-1/2-year lows, shedding 3.4 percent this month, on worries about growth prospects in China and tensions with North Korea, despite suspected intervention by Seoul to stem the currency's fall.Elsewhere, the oil markets maintain their firmness as short-sellers have reduced their positions following major oil producing countries' decision to freeze output earlier this month.While the measure is unlikely to solve the persistent supply glut in the market, it was seen as a first step for further cooperation in the future.International Brent futures climbed 1.1 percent from their last close to $35.49 per barrel, 2.2 percent above its levels at the end of January.",2016-02-29,0.0,0.0,0.3065425490425491,0.04646654771654772

Japan's Nikkei firmed 0.8 percent, on top of a 4-percent jump the previous session.""Value is starting to snap back and some sectors that pretty recently were hanging around all-time lows are showing signs of life,"" said Nicholas Smith, a strategist at CLSA.""The general updraft in oil is helping confidence as well. Investors aren't yet ready to take on a lot of risk, but they are adding to their positions.""Energy and bank stocks had led Wall Street higher on Wednesday, giving the Dow a gain of 0.2 percent. The S&amp;P 500 added 0.41 percent and the Nasdaq 0.29 percent.The calmer mood showed in the CBOE Volatility index, a measure of investor anxiety, which closed at its lowest level so far this year.Sentiment was underpinned by a report showing US private sector jobs rose a surprisingly strong 214,000 in February, adding to speculation Friday's payrolls report would also be upbeat.strong>NOT SO FAST</strongYet fissures remain in the global outlook, argued Justin Fabo, a senior economist at Australia and New Zealand Bank.Despite the latest bounce in commodities, prices were still very weak and a lot of money had been borrowed on the assumption that they would not be.""China has huge potential to roil markets as the nation navigates a difficult structural transition,"" he said.

US crude futures also rose to $38.11 per barrel, its highest since early January.Further improving the mood in the battered commodity sector, spot iron ore price surged almost 20 percent, hitting a near nine-month high on the back of China's plans to boost short-term output.Ecuador's Foreign Minister, Guillaume Long, said his government will host a meeting in Quito on Friday with Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador and Mexico ""to reach consensus over oil, especially prices.""In the currency market, investors rushed back to commodity-linked currencies, sending the Australian dollar to as high as $0.7486 on Monday, its highest in almost eight months.The Aussie last stood at $0.7424.The Canadian dollar also firmed to a 3-1/2-month high of C$1.3262 per US dollar and last stood at C$1.3290.In Latin America, the Mexican peso, the Chilean peso and the Colombian peso all hit multi-month highs.While the dollar was soft in general, major currencies saw limited moves.

China's export data was horrendous,"" Matt Smith of Clipper Data said in a daily report.China's February trade performance was far worse than economists had expected, with exports tumbling the most in over six years.Although China imported record crude volumes of 8 million barrels per day (bpd) in February, analysts expect this figure to fall as the government scales back purchases of strategic reserves, and car sales begin to fall as the sharpest economic slowdown in a generation starts to show results.The price dips at least temporarily halted a price rally that started in mid-February on hopes that a coordinated freeze in production would stop growth in a global supply glut of at least 1 billion bpd above consumption that helped pull prices down as much as 70 percent since 2014.But OPEC-member Kuwait, this week poured cold water on hopes of such a freeze by stating that it would only cap output if all major producers participate, including Iran, which has balked at the plan.One key factor in determining the oil market balance will be US output, which the government said would be 8.19 million bpd in 2017, down from over 9 million bpd currently.But with demand growth also slowing, many analysts including influential bank Goldman Sachs, say that it will take time for markets to fully rebalance.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said that it expects ""the annual average (oil) price for 2016 being lower than 2015 and then recovering in 2017, reflecting large oversupply and high stock levels during the first half of 2016"".It added that the main risks to its forecast were changes in demand in China and the extent to which Iran manages to increase oil exports after sanctions against it were lifted in January.",2016-03-09,0.0,0.0,0.4548412698412697,-0.0812346681096681

3713,Asia markets slip before BOJ Fed oil sli,"strong>HONG KONG: Asian stocks slipped on Tuesday and the dollar firmed as investors braced for policy decisions from major central banks this week, with all eyes on the Bank of Japan's decision later in the day after it stunned markets in January by adopting negative rates.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan dipped 0.7 percent, backing off a 2-1/2-month high on Monday.It was dragged down by a 1.2 percent fall in resource-heavy Australian shares and a 0.7 percent drop in Hong Kong.""Markets are not expecting another round of stimulus so soon after January's surprise from the BOJ and overall sentiment has become more cautious after the recent risk rally,"" said Frances Cheung, a rates strategist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.With the global economy slowing and many countries facing deflationary pressures, investors' attention was squarely on policy decisions from the world's major central banks.The Bank of Japan is expected to announce its policy decision between 0230-0430 GMT on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday and the Bank of England and the Swiss National Bank on Thursday.The BOJ is widely expected to keep policy unchanged after its surprise decision in January to introduce negative interest rates raised worries about banks' profitability.Notwithstanding the BOJ's decision, Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citibank, reckons investors are more interested in the Fed statement on Wednesday to gauge how important global vulnerabilities stack up against an upswing in domestic activity for U.S. policymakers.The Fed is unlikely to raise rates this week but it will likely make clear that as long as U.S. inflation and jobs continue to strengthen, economic weakness overseas won't stop rates from rising fairly soon.A consensus in the market is that fresh forecasts from the Fed's 17 officials released after the meeting will signal perhaps two or three rate hikes this year, a retreat from their projection in December for four or more increases in 2016.Financial markets are much more cautious with Fed fund futures are pricing in a 50 percent probability of a rate increase by June and one full rate hike by December.The mood in credit markets also was noticeably more cautious, with investors happy to stay in high quality government debt such as U.S. Treasuries and German Bunds rather than venturing into higher-yielding corporate paper.The 10-year U.S. notes yield stood at 1.969 percent, off a six-week high of 1.986 percent hit on Friday.In credit markets too, a recent rally seems to be petering out. An index of high yield credit fell after rising 9 percent over the last month.Even oil prices, whose rebound over the last month triggered a global rally in risky assets, were running out of steam on concerns that a six-week market recovery may have gone beyond fundamentals. U.S. crude stockpiles continue to rise and Iran is seen showing little interest in joining major producers in freezing production.U.S. crude futures last traded at $37.05 a barrel, up slightly from Monday.On Monday, they fell 3.4 percent to $37.18 a barrel, while Brent finished down 2 percent at $39.53.In currency markets, the euro slipped further from its three-week high hit after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi indicated he does not plan further cuts in interest rates.The euro traded at $1.1111, off Thursday's high of $1.1218.

That data is expected to show crude inventories rose to a record for a fifth straight week.""For today, we may see some strength for prices coming from possible US production declines,"" said Singapore-based Phillip Futures in a note today, although it does not expect US and Brent prices to rise higher than $39.83 and $40.17 per barrel, respectively.US shale producer Linn Energy said on Tuesday that bankruptcy may be unavoidable as the company missed interest payments amid a slump in oil prices of as much as 70 percent since mid-2014.Other companies, also fighting for survival, are seeking risky and costly borrowing from private equity firms.Despite Wednesday's price rises, oil markets remain dogged by a global glut which sees over 1 million barrels of crude pumped every day in excess of demand.And analysts warned that a recent bull-run which saw crude markets jump over 40 percent from multi-year lows earlier this year was overblown and largely driven by speculative traders buying crude from producers who were selling it as a financial hedge.""Producers are not buying the rumour-mill... In fact, it is just the opposite: speculators are buying what producers are selling... Speculators are record long Brent (on ICE) while producers are record short... Who do you think is going to win out?"" said the US-based The Schork Report in a note to clients.Fundamentally, there are few changes to the supply balance.While Saudi Arabia and Russia have proposed to freeze their output at January volumes, near record levels of over 10 million barrels per day (bpd) each, Iran has said it would only participate once its production hits 4 million bpd from a current 3 million bpd.""Any such deal (to freeze output) would still not be a game changer.

It is up 16 percent from January's lows. Japanese markets were closed for a holiday.""Despite the current rally in risk, we are more inclined to be broadly bearish on emerging markets given the underlying weakening trend,"" said Frances Cheung, head of rates strategy, Asia ex-Japan at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.Stocks in China and Hong Kong rose, but equity markets elsewhere in the region edged lower with Taiwan and Australia leading losses.In the absence of any fresh major economic data in a holiday-shortened week, investors were left to ponder the softer tightening bias from the Fed even as the US economic recovery appeared to be gathering fresh steam.Dollar bulls were hit hard last week after the Fed's less hawkish stance which cut the projected rate hikes for the rest of the year by half to only two. Financial markets, as seen by money market futures, are barely pricing in one.Fed Chair Janet Yellen sounded doubtful that a recent firming in US inflation would be sustained, suggesting the central bank is in no hurry to tighten policy.Some such as Francis Cheung, China strategist at brokerage CLSA, said the Fed's renewed caution would encourage Beijing to pursue with its own stimulus measures to boost the economy.

At 9.3 times, Hong Kong's stock market was trading comfortably below one standard deviation its 20-year average.China's economy is showing signs of improvement while capital outflows from the country are moderating, top Chinese officials said on Sunday.Easing outflows and the softer dollar are resulting in less pressure on the yuan currency, which could give the central bank more confidence to cut interest rates and banks' reserve requirements again after largely weak data in January and February, some market watchers say.However, softer oil prices dampened sentiment.Oil slipped for a second session, extending Friday's slide of over 1 percent after the US rig count rose for the first time since December, renewing worries of a supply glut after an output freeze proposal had helped boost the market to 2016 highs.US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures fell more than 1 percent to $39.01 per barrel after briefly topping $41, its highest since last December.Brent crude edged lower to $41.04 per barrel after hitting this year's peak of $42.54 per barrel.Rate markets also cheered the Fed's cautiousness with 10-year and two-year US yields down by 14 and 16 basis points since the US central bank's meeting last week.Credit markets basked in the afterglow of the recent rally with an index of high-yield credit extending gains to be up 9 percent in roughly a month.In currencies, the dollar index was little changed at 95.01, not far from a five-month trough of 94.578 set on Friday.The greenback fetched 111.31 yen, still within reach of Friday's 17-month low of 110.67.

Growth is projected to slow further to 6.3 percent in 2017, ADB said.The bank's 2016 forecast for China, down from a December estimate of 6.7 percent, is at the lower end of Beijing's own target of 6.5-7 percent as the government presses ahead with painful reforms, though Premier Li Keqiang has vowed that would not lead to a hard landing.Weak prices for oil and other commodities also cast a shadow over the prospects of Asia's commodity-dependent economies, the ADB said.In the United States, expanding private consumption and investment will be tempered by weak external demand, the ADB said. US Federal Reserve policymakers have cited continuing risks from a shaky global economy in halving the number of potential interest rate hikes this year to two.Growth in India will slip to 7.4 percent this year from 7.6 percent in 2015, but should recover to 7.8 percent in 2017, the ADB said.For all of South Asia, ADB forecast growth at 6.9 percent in 2016 and 7.3 percent in 2017, versus growth of 7.0 percent last year.Economies in Southeast Asia are projected to expand 4.5 percent this year, from 4.4 percent in 2015, and by 4.8 percent in 2017.For East Asia, ADB sees growth at 5.7 percent in 2016 and 5.6 percent in 2017.

Overnight, it dropped 1.6 percent, its biggest fall in almost two months.While global risky assets has staged a smart recovery since February's lows, led by Chinese stock markets on hopes that Beijing can successfully avert a sharp slowdown, policymakers and investors are worried the recovery may be at best, bumpy, or at worst, short-lived.Alex Wolf, emerging markets economist at Standard Life Investments said it is still too early to call an economic stabilization in China because property inventories are still very high and much of the recent economic activity was driven by quasi-fiscal spending.""A rebound based on property exuberance and quasi-fiscal stimulus means it might be more transient than the market wants to believe,"" he said in a note.Data last week showed foreigners are estimated to have pumped $36.8 billion into emerging market stocks and bonds in March, the highest monthly inflow in nearly two years, the Institute of International Finance said.On Wall Street, the S&amp;P 500 lost 1.01 percent on Tuesday as investors took profits on recent gains ahead of a quarterly reporting season that is expected to reveal sharply lower earnings.In addition, the US trade deficit widened more than expected in February in the latest indication that economic growth in the world's largest economy weakened further in the first quarter.The data prompted economists to cut their first-quarter gross domestic product growth estimates by as much as half a percentage point to as low as a 0.4 percent annualized rate, which would be its slowest growth in two years.Risk aversion was evident in currency and fixed income markets as well.Investors also bought back the yen, a low-yield currency that investors often sell to seek higher yields elsewhere when risk appetite is strong.The yen hit a 17-month high of 109.92 to the dollar on Tuesday after Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said countries should avoid seeking to weaken their currencies with ""arbitrary intervention."" It last traded at 110.48.His comments dimmed any prospects of currency intervention by the Japanese authorities to stem the yen's rise in the near future, analysts said.The euro was little changed at $1.1376, hovering not far from its 5 1/2-month high of $1.1438.German 10-year yield fell below 0.10 percent for the first time since April last year, edging near its record low of around 0.05 percent touched almost a year ago.The 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield dropped to a five-week low of 1.715 percent, having fallen almost 0.3 percentage point from its March 16 peak of 2.002 percent.The two-year yield fell to a near six-week low of 0.716 percent while traders reduced bets on a Fed rate hike in June further.Oil offered the sole bright spot in financial markets with prices extending their rebound after Kuwait insisted major producers will agree to freeze output later this month even as key player Iran continued to balk at the plan.The market was also helped by data on US crude supply-demand for last week from industry group American Petroleum Institute (API) showing a surprise fall of 4.3 million barrels in inventories in the week to April 1, versus an expected weekly increase of 3.2 million barrels.Brent crude futures LCOc1 rose 1.6 percent to $38.48 per barrel, off one-month low of $37.27 hit on Tuesday.

The CSI 300 was down 0.8 percent, set for a 1.2 percent weekly decline. Hong Kong's Hang Seng slipped 0.7 percent, headed for 1.9 percent loss for the week.Bank shares led losses in Europe and the US markets on Thursday, amid talk of more layoffs and cutbacks planned by Europe's major lenders as they struggle with zero rates.The US S&amp;P 500 Index lost 1.2 percent, with financial shares falling 1.9 percent. In Europe, the FTSEurofirst 300 closed down 0.8 percent, hurt by a drop of more than 2 percent in financials.""When bank shares are making big falls and their CDS spreads are rising like this, obviously you would think something is afoot. If they keep falling in today's session, that is going to be really worrying,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.US stock futures slipped about 0.1 percent further in Asian trade after Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, in a conversation with former Fed chairmen, said the US economy is on a solid course and still on track to warrant further interest rate hikes.Despite a chorus of comments from Fed policymakers about more rate hikes, many investors think the global economy is too weak to allow the Fed to raise rates all that fast.The 10-year US Treasuries yield fell to six-week low of 1.685 percent on Thursday, and was last trading at 1.7097. US interest rate futures maintained their firmness, pricing in a less than 20 percent chance of a rate hike in June.Lower yields undermined the dollar, given that prospects of higher US yields were the main attraction behind the currency's firmness.Investors instead bought back the yen which had been long under pressure due to the Bank of Japan's massive monetary easing.""Japan's move towards negative rates, amid a general inability to create substantial nominal GDP and therefore inflation, is now resulting in a wave of JPY buying,"" Chris Weston, chief market strategist at IG in Melbourne, wrote in a note.Traders believe it would be hard for Japanese authorities to intervene to stem the yen's rise after the Group of 20 agreement in February warned countries to refrain from competitive devaluation.Finance Minister Taro Aso said on Friday Japan will take necessary steps on currencies, but declined to comment on the issue of intervention.The yen strengthened to 107.67 to the dollar on Thursday, its highest since October 2014, and last stood at 108.64, heading for a weekly gain of 2.6 percent.The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six rival currencies, was up about 0.1 percent at 94.583, poised for a flat weekly performance.The euro also hit a six-month high of $1.1454 the previous day and last fetched $1.1361, set to end the week up 0.2 percent.On the other hand, commodity-linked currencies and many emerging economy currencies stepped back from recent multi-month highs as risk-averse mood took hold on investors.The Australian dollar traded at $0.7533, having fallen 1.3 percent on Thursday.In the commodities market, copper suffered its biggest fall in more than six months on Thursday, slumping 2.8 percent on the day and hitting a six-week low of $4,631 a tonne.China may be about to shock the global copper market by unleashing some of its stockpiles of the metal, which are near record highs, on to the global market.The metal was last trading at $4,660 a tonne.Oil prices rose on Friday after firm economic indicators from the US and Germany implied support for fuel demand, but analysts warned another downturn could be on the way due to ongoing oversupply.Global benchmark Brent crude futures climbed 1.3 percent to $39.96 per barrel, set for an increase of 3.4 percent on the week.

""The port cranes are almost ready, and we are thinking that the port will be (at) full operation by the end of this year,"" said Zhang Baozhong, chairman and CEO of China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd.The Chinese company took over Gwadar´s operations in 2013. The revamped port has three multipurpose berths and its inner is dredged to 11.5 metres. ""We´re expecting at least one million tons of material will go in and out"" next year, Zhang said, speaking at a day-long conference in Gwadar city.The projected traffic represents a 100 percent increase over this year´s throughput, but is a far cry from the 300-400 million tons per year that the Gwadar Port Authority envisions for the facility, which has ambitions of becoming a regional hub.Zhang acknowledged that Gwadar now had minuscule traffic - mostly Pakistani government-subsidised fertilizer imports - but he predicted a swift transformation in coming years.Part of the problem is that the new roads that CPEC is expected to build, linking the port to China´s industrial zones, have not yet come online and the Pakistani province of Baluchistan does not have enough export-ready products.""Even if you have a very good port, (if) you don´t have an inland transporting system and the economy in the near area is not very positive, the port will not be fully utilised,"" he said.He added that his company planned to develop seafood processing plants and other facilities in a 923 hectare free zone outside the port. One of Gwadar´s main industries is fishing but it is not done on a scale that is suitable for export. ",2016-04-12,0.5,0.2,0.40978176995418386,0.1340338397234949

They will discuss measures to rein in ballooning oversupply which sees as many as 2 million barrels of crude produced every day in excess of demand, leaving storage tanks around the world filled to the rims with unsold and unwanted fuel.Most analysts expect producers to freeze output around current output levels, which being beyond consumption and close to record levels would do little to address the glut.""The potential risk for prices is for the downside as freezing output at current levels would be more of a symbolic act rather than a real market intervention. But you need to be open to surprises in this market,"" said Ric Spooner, chief market analyst at CMC Markets in Sydney.While Spooner said that a production freeze would do little to address the immediate glut, he added that keeping key Middle East and Russian output around current levels might in the longer term lead to a more balanced market.""There is demand growth, and production in the U.S. is falling, so if against that background there was a freeze, markets could get tighter at some stage,"" he said.Analysts at Bernstein said that they expected global oil demand to grow at a mean annual rate of 1.4 percent between 2016 and 2020, versus annual growth of 1.1 percent over the past decade, adding that global demand would reach 101.1 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2020 from 94.6 million bpd now.Looking further into the future, Bernstein said that world oil demand would likely peak in the 2030s.""The world will reach 'peak demand' before 'peak supply'.

US West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures were down around half a dollar, or 1.2 percent, at $43.22 a barrel.Analysts said the price drops were largely a result of cashing in after three weeks of rising prices. ""I guess (there´s been) some profit taking after a strong<br/>rally into the end of last week,"" said Virendra Chauhan of Energy Aspects in Singapore.Market data shows that the amount of open positions betting on rising WTI prices rose to levels last seen in June 2015 last week. At the same time, the amount of deals taken out in expectations of falling prices fell close to 2016 lows and levels prior last seen in the second quarter of last year.""If the selling pressure lasts through today, I suspect there´ll be a bit of a dent in the newest data when it gets released tomorrow,"" said one crude trader.A jump in the dollar on Friday against a basket of other leading currencies on expectations that Japan will further extend its aggressive monetary easing through negative interest rates, also dented oil.A stronger dollar, in which oil is traded, makes fuel imports for countries using other currencies more expensive, potentially hitting demand. Monday´s early oil price drops came despite another decline in the US rig-count that brings activity down for a fifth straight week and to levels last seen in November 2009.A total of 343 rigs were drilling for new oil last week.That compares to over 700 this time last year, according to oil services company Baker Hughes Inc on Friday.

It will invest more than 4 billion euros ($4.5 billion) in 2016 alone in such areas as environmental and safety technology, said Jochem Heizmann, who heads the German company's operations here.China is VW's most important market. With the government planning to adopt the world's toughest emissions regulations in 2017, the automaker intends to roll out 15 eco-car models over the next three to four years. It will begin full-scale production of a plug-in hybrid based on the Golf around 2018.Toyota Motor plans to build a plug-in-hybrid version of the Corolla starting that year. The company arranged the rollout schedule to coincide with a number of planned launches of plug-in hybrids by other automakers, said Hiroji Onishi, head of China operations.Honda Motor  will begin production of an Accord hybrid this July and release a plug-in hybrid in 2020. Market leader General Motors plans to spend 100 billion yuan ($15.3 billion) over the next five years to promote sales of electric and other vehicles.China led the world in new-car sales for a seventh straight year in 2015, at 24.59 million vehicles. Even if market growth slows, many still see plenty of room for expansion, given that the country has just over one car for every 10 people. Automakers are scrambling to roll out new models to take advantage of generous subsidies for eco-car purchases.But ""demand is strong now because of the tax break on compact cars that started last October,"" said Nobuhiko Watabe, an executive officer at Mazda Motor, adding that the true state of affairs is dire.

The more tame Fed tightening cycle, compared to expectations last year, should also support gold,"" Steel said.MKS Group trader Sam Laughlin said support around $1,230 should keep the metal buoyant, though gains will be limited by the Fed announcement on Wednesday.Speculation of further easing sent the yen reeling against the dollar late last week, but uncertainty over whether the BOJ will actually deliver fresh stimulus at its April 27-28 meeting saw the Japanese currency recover some ground.The Fed also holds a policy meeting this week, with the two-day gathering kicking off on Tuesday.

""That shows that something is not working.""Volkswagen plans to pay the 12 current and former members of its management board 63.24 million euros ($72.44 million) for 2015, a year when Europe's largest carmaker posted a record loss due to legal and compensation costs for cheating diesel emissions tests.The company withheld a small part of bonus payments but will award them at a later date if certain performance criteria are fulfilled, including a recovery of the Volkswagen's share price.The bonus payouts have sparked public outrage in Germany and a spat within Volkswagen's supervisory board.Lower Saxony, VW's second-largest shareholder, had called for executive bonuses to be scrapped or cut as Europe's largest automaker counts the multi-billion-euro costs of ""Dieselgate"".Joerg Bode, a former supervisory board member who had represented Lower Saxony, told weekly Welt am Sonntag that ex-CEO Martin Winterkorn and his colleagues should pay back the part of the bonuses that had been generated by ""cost cuts through fraud"".Current supervisory board member Bernd Osterloh said last week that the carmaker should look beyond contractual obligations and that the management board should volunteer to cut their bonus payments. ""It is also about morals,"" he had said.Osterloh also said that the supervisory board should also discuss changes to its own remuneration system once the dieselgate scandal has been resolved.""As soon as business is back to normal we should think about changing the (remuneration) system (of the supervisory board),"" Osterloh was quoted by Welt am Sonntag as saying.A swift change to fixed salaries and abolishing variable pay components tied to dividends would be a wrong signal as that would effectively lead to a hike in remuneration, the Volkswagen labor chief told the paper.Following its record 2015 loss VW had slashed its dividend to 0.17 euros per preferred share from 4.86 euros.",2016-05-01,0.0,0.0,0.32862318840579713,0.08928571428571427

3783,Pakistan succeeds in growing its apparel industry,"KARACHI: Pakistan has been successful in establishing and growing its apparel manufacturing industry, however, more can be done to realize its potential as a regional hub and to continue to boost opportunities, especially for women and the poor, according to a new World Bank report.The Stitches to Riches Apparel Employment Trade and Economic Development, launched in Pakistan today, is aimed at demystifying the global and South Asian apparel markets, estimating the potential gains in exports and jobs and identifying policies that can unleash country s export and job potential compared with those of their closest competitors in the Southeast Asia region  Vietnam, Cambodia and Indonesia.The report finds that it is important for South Asian economies to remove existing impediments and facilitate growth in apparel to capture more production and create more employment as wages rise in China.The successful manufacturers will be those who can supply a wide range of quality products to buyers rapidly and reliably, not just those who offer low costs.China currently dominates global apparel trade but that may change in coming years due to the rising prices in China.Investors are compelled to seek out apparel firms in other countries. The potential decrease in Chinese exports presents a huge opportunity for South Asian countries.A 10 percent increase in Chinese apparel prices would increase apparel employment in Pakistan for males by 8.93 percent, by far the biggest winner, followed by Bangladesh 4.22 percent and India 3.32 percent.Women are also expected to benefit the most as their share in the total apparel employment is much higher than their share in other industries. This is true for Pakistan as well.The report finds that 1 percent increase in expected wages in Pakistan would raise the probability of women entering the labor force by 16.3 percent. Job creation is among the governments top priorities.Apparel manufacturing presents the poor with job opportunities in Pakistan, especially for females, says Illango Patchamuthu, World Bank Country Director for Pakistan.These employed women would in return spend more on the health and education of their children which will contribute towards the larger development goals of the country.Pakistan has a fast growing apparel sector that accounts for 19 percent of its exports and firms are competitive with global exporters in terms of prices.Yet despite low prices in most apparel product categories, Pakistan lags competitors in reliability and policy continuation. It also remains highly concentrated in cotton products.South Asia has taken many steps in recent years to support the textile and apparel sector but it now needs to step up its game by tackling inefficiencies that are undercutting its competitiveness, says Gladys C Lopez Acevedo, one of the authors of the report and a Lead Economist for the World Bank.Pakistan should use this opportunity and implement policies to become a regional leader in creating good jobs, bringing more women into the work force and diversifying its products and end markets to increase skills and value.The report suggests that Pakistan could benefit from the following policies. Increase product diversity by reducing barriers on imports to ease access to man-made fibers such as duty and tax remission for exports and export processing zones.",2016-05-06,0.1,0.7,0.49749125874125877,0.13502622377622378
3784,Pakistan woos Renault and Nissan in push for auto inv,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan is wooing foreign car makers like Renault and Nissan with generous import duties, but convincing them to set up factories will be an uphill challenge given fears about the country's long-term political stability and security.</strongPakistan wants to shake up its Japanese-dominated car market and loosen the grip of Toyota, Honda, and Suzuki, whose locally assembled cars are sold at relatively high prices but lag behind imported vehicles in terms of quality and specifications.To do that, analysts say, the government must convince manufacturers that the country has turned a corner after a decade of economic turbulence and a series of major attacks by militant groups including the Taliban.With the economy growing at its fastest pace in eight years, the local currency stable against the dollar and interest rates at their lowest in 42 years, Pakistani officials believe the country is once again on the radar of investors seeking to tap into a market of nearly 200 million people.Officials are touting a new auto policy, skewed in favour of new entrants, that includes offering foreign car manufacturers lower duties as an incentive to set up plants in Pakistan or revive shuttered ones.""We expect that there will be one or two foreign investors coming into Pakistan,"" said Miftah Ismail, chairman of Pakistan's Board of Investment, who has been talking to car makers about setting up assembly plants for the local market.Ismail told Reuters he had held talks with Japan's Nissan and France's Renault for ""some time"", and last month met Fiat executives in Italy for the first time.Previous discussions also involved Germany's Volkswagen.""I hope some people will bite,"" he said.A source close to Renault said Pakistan was under consideration for new production investment, along with other potential locations, but added that discussions were at a very early stage. In an e-mailed statement, the company said it had ""no news to announce at this time"".Nissan chief spokesman Jonathan Adashek said: ""Pakistan is certainly a market of interest for us at present"", but added no final decision had been made.strong>STABILITY</strongAnalysts say the odds are stacked against Pakistan finalising deals, despite the concessions on offer.A major obstacle is the perennial concern about political stability.The threat of militant attacks also remains high, despite the armed forces' long-running campaign against groups including the Taliban.Foreign companies have been reluctant to invest large sums when the long-term outlook is so uncertain.""There is potential in Pakistan. There is no doubt about that,"" said Puneet Gupta, associate director at consultant IHS Automotive. ""(But) we really don't feel Pakistan is in a relatively stable condition, from a mid to long-term perspective.""Another potential turn off for investors is the size of Pakistan's car market, where 180,000 cars were sold in the 2014/2015 fiscal year. That compares with more than 2 million passenger vehicles a year in neighbouring India.""The Pakistan market is not big enough,"" said Mumshad Ali, chairman of the Pakistan Association of Automotive Parts.He added that the government's new policies were probably not bold enough to tempt new manufacturers, nor did they address ways to increase demand, such as lowering sales taxes.The local manufacturing partners of Suzuki, Toyota and Honda did not respond to requests for comment.But Ali said they felt aggrieved that the government was favouring new investors and believed they should be similarly encouraged to build new plants and expand existing factories.Ismail said new entrants would be able to import machinery for plants duty free. Customs duty for importing car parts has been set at 10 percent, while existing players will have to pay 30 percent.""We want greater competition, and we expect with greater competition consumers will be offered better choices,"" he said.Some Pakistanis are frustrated by high prices and the quality of locally produced cars, which tend not to have airbags, anti-lock breaking systems (ABS) and other features considered standard elsewhere.The cheapest Pakistani car, the Suzuki Mehran, sells for 650,000 Pakistani rupee ($6,200), or about double the price of a comparable model in India.""Local cars are so bad,"" said Ali Paracha, owner of a car rental company.

Experts say the economy needs to expand by at least 6 percent a year to absorb new entrants to the work force.Illango Patchamuthu, the World Bank country director, said Pakistan had benefited from a collapse in global oil prices and tough fiscal measures by the government over the past few years to stabilise the economy.But he urged faster reform in the energy sector, which has suffered decades of under-investment. Businesses say frequent power outages hurt growth and investment.""To me, the whole story around power reforms is still only half done,"" Patchamuthu told Reuters in an interview.He said Pakistan must tackle its so-called circular debt problem, which stems from unpaid government subsidies that build up until power plant owners cannot afford fuel. It stands at about $3 billion.The government expects its electricity rationing system of ""load-shedding"" to end by 2018 after it signed more than $30 billion in energy generation projects as part of the $46 billion China-Pakistan Economic Project.But efforts to privatise a host of electricity distribution companies have stalled, as have other reforms.Patchamuthu said the government has been focused on power generation, but it must also seek to improve distribution and upgrade ancient transmission systems.""A lot more needs to be done in the next several years to build up the whole power infrastructure,"" he said.Patchamuthu said another way for Pakistan to significantly boost growth is reforming its male-dominated labour market, where women account for only 22 percent of the workforce.""If Pakistan wants to get to 7-8 percent (growth) with structural reforms, they also have to much more in drawing women into the labour force,"" he said.""There are social and cultural challenges,"" Patchamuthu said. ""But if the women are skilled and they are given the right opportunities  the economy is only going to bloom and blossom.""",2016-05-10,0.0,0.0,0.40478753702437914,0.05854883420672894

As for OPEC, it has practically stopped existing as a united organization.""""The company (Rosneft) was skeptical from the very beginning about the possibility of reaching any sort of joint agreement with OPEC's involvement in current conditions,"" said Sechin, in comments over the weekend which were embargoed until Tuesday.""Just to remind you, the only one question with which we responded to those who were interested to know our position: 'Who should we agree with, and how?' The development of the situation has clearly shown we were right.""Sechin's comments about the end of the era when OPEC could influence prices chime with those of Saudi Arabia's newly appointed energy minister Khaled al-Falih.Falih, who took over on Saturday from long-serving Ali al-Naimi, has been very vocal in the past year about his views that the oil market needs to rebalance through low prices and that the Saudis have the resources to wait.Falih's ultimate boss, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who oversees Saudi oil policies, has also signaled that the world is moving to a new era where supply and demand rather than OPEC will determine prices.Sechin, who was born in 1960 - the same year as Falih - is also calling on Russia to abandon any hope that prices can be fixed by anything other than market rebalancing.""At the moment, key factors which are influencing the market are finance, technology and regulation.

This means banks cannot use the dollar for any deals with Iran, while U.S. banks are barred from doing business outright.While the U.S. embargo does not in theory prevent non-U.S. banks from dealing with Iran, in reality many remain hesitant to do so because they faced hefty fines in the past and are wary of the U.S. sanctions that remain in place.",2016-05-15,0.0,0.0,0.4430555555555556,-0.045833333333333316

3808,problems G7 finance ministers world,"strong>DUBLIN: Finance ministers from the world's largest developed economies met in Germany a year ago against a backdrop of faltering global growth, scant inflationary pressures and the latest chapter in the Greek debt crisis.</strongWhen they and their G7 central bank colleagues convene again in Japan on Friday the first two items remain just as problematic as and potentially even trickier than a year ago. Only unusually smooth talks between Athens and its lenders may keep Greece off the agenda this time around.The hosts' monetary and fiscal policy trajectory appears obvious: the Bank of Japan is coming under increasing pressure to counter a damaging rise in the value of the yen that could derail a fragile recovery for the world's third-largest economy.Talk of more action gathered pace after an academic seen to be close to Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the BOJ is likely to expand monetary stimulus either in June or July. The government has also said Tokyo is ready to intervene in currency markets.Whether explicitly on the agenda or not, such interventions are certain to be brought up by counterparts from France, Italy, Germany, Britain, Canada and the United States either side of a planned field trip to see how the northeastern Japanese city of Sendai has recovered from the devastating 2011 earthquake.On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe beat the drum for a broader fiscal stimulus, saying most G7 leaders agreed it was necessary as a means of boosting global demand, though getting all of them to enact the same policy steps would be tough.First-quarter Japanese economic output data on Wednesday - following on from more signs of slowing growth in China - should flesh out the downbeat picture with quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) forecast to have expanded just 0.1 percent, according to a Reuters poll.""The Bank of Japan has been heavily criticized for its decision not to take further economic stimulus measures at its meeting in April,"" said Commerzbank economist Bernd Weidensteiner.""Because of its refusal to bow to the market expectations of 'more and more', the central bank currently faces a tough task to convince the markets of its policy actions.""FED PUZZLEThings are not so straightforward for the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is caught in a bind over when to push interest rates higher amid concerns about the health of the labor market at home and fears about the knock-on effects its actions will have abroad. There was fresh hesitation among economists ahead of the release in the coming week of the minutes from the April 26/27 Fed meeting when the central bank's rate-setting committee acknowledged that economic growth seemed to have slowed.The Fed will likely wait until September before raising rates again, a Reuters poll found this week, stretching to nine months the time since its first hike in nearly a decade as it waits for clear signs inflation is picking up.April's U.S. inflation figures arrive on Tuesday, a day before the euro zone give an update on its battle to register any kind of price growth and the same day Britain releases its consumer price data for last month.British price growth is expected to have slowed after a pick up in March while jobless numbers on Wednesday may also show a dip in hiring in the first quarter as employers turn cautious ahead of June's Brexit vote. Retail sales are due on Thursday.Latest polling on the EU membership referendum will be just as closely watched to see if the Bank of England's warning that Brexit would slow the economy sharply, and could even push it into recession, has had any impact on voters.""Signs of a slowing economy and uncertainty around Britain's EU referendum appear to have resulted in a shift in emphasis from permanent to temporary hiring among UK employers,"" Markit economist Oliver Kolodseike said.

This is the highest since at least 2008, according to a Reuters review of past OPEC reports.Also weighing on markets was recovering output in Canada following forced closures due to a wildfire, as well as a 3 percent rise in the dollar this month against other leading currencies.  A firmer dollar makes dollar-traded fuel imports more expensive for countries using other currencies, potentially weighing on demand.",2016-05-16,0.0,0.0,0.4523437499999999,-0.1684895833333333

3814,Unusual heat bakes Sri Lanka chicken industry,"strong>COLOMBO: As noon-time temperatures began soaring in late March, Mohamed Nizam, a small-scale chicken seller, knew he was headed for trouble.</strongSoon the mid-day heat was touching 40 degrees Celsius, and Nizam told his workers to pour water on to the pavement in front of his shop in the Colombo suburb of Wattala in an effort to ward off the heat.""But nothing can keep that kind of heat from getting to the chickens. It roasts them alive,"" Nizam said.Across Sri Lanka, small- and medium-scale chicken producers  often with between 1,000 and 25,000 birds  are struggling to keep their birds alive in the face of temperatures 2 degrees to 5 degrees Celsius above normal over the last two months.Many of the birds live in tightly packed pens, where the heat makes them dehydrated. Larger industrial operations use fans and spray water on them, but smaller operations cannot afford such investments.Usually when the heat is high, we use ice or water to keep the pens cool. This time they were no match for the heat. I lost half of my stock, said Rumi Jamaldean, who runs a farm with around 8,000 birds in the Kurunegala District, about 120 kilometres from Colombo.strong>RISING PRICES</strongThe losses have translated into big hikes in chicken prices. In Colombo and its suburbs a kilo of fresh chicken was selling for 620 rupees (around $5.50) during the first week of May. Two months earlier it was Rs 450 and a year ago Rs 400.My sales have dropped, Nizam said, estimating they had fallen by 40 percent. People cant afford it. The prices are way too much, he said.With chicken by far the most popular meat in this largely Buddhist nation that shuns many other types of meat, the price hike is likely to have an impact on nutrition. On average a Sri Lankan eats seven times as much chicken per year as beef, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.The nations poultry industry produces about 165,000 metric tons of meat a year, according to the Department of Animal Production and Health.Sri Lankan chicken farmers have long experience with warm months and often use homegrown methods to keep their birds cool, including ice, water, fans or sometimes feeding the birds sodium-bicarbonate, which growers say can help prevent dehydration.But this time the heat was too much and nothing could have prevented such losses, said Nimal Jayaratne, head of the Department of Animal Production and Health.According to the Meteorological Department, during the fourth week of April the Northern Vavuniya District recorded an average daily temperature of 37 degrees Celsius. During the same time period, rain fall was below average.It has been extremely warm, warmer than any other time in the past five years, said Lal Chandrapala, director general of the Meteorological Department.Experts and farmers agree that Sri Lankas small-scale chicken farmers are not ready to deal with such extreme heat.If you look at the pens, they are just brick sheds with corrugated tin sheets on the roof. During times when the weather is okay, they can work. But when the heat comes, there is hardly any room for ventilation and there is no money to invest to save the stock, Jayaratne said.Chicken farmer Jamaldean said he will absorb the losses as much as he can, pass some portion of it to his customers, and just wait until the heat passes, with cooler monsoon weather due late this month or in early June.But chicken prices will not come down soon. It will take at least two months, warned Nizam.",2016-05-18,0.975,-0.19999999999999998,0.5180575071558676,-0.012816573226409287

3816,IMF backs Saudi economic ,"strong>DUBAI: The International Monetary Fund backed Saudi Arabia's sweeping economic reform plan on Thursday and said the kingdom was cutting spending at the right speed to cope with a huge state budget deficit caused by low oil prices.</strongLate last month, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman announced steps to reduce the kingdom's dependence on oil exports over the next 15 years, including subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment.The IMF had for years been urging Saudi Arabia to adopt many of those measures, and in a statement on Thursday it said the reform plan aimed for ""an appropriately bold and far-reaching transformation of the Saudi Arabian economy"".""The supporting policies that will be announced in the coming months are expected to set out how these goals will be achieved,"" IMF official Tim Callen said after leading a team to Saudi Arabia this month for annual consultations with the Fund.""To ensure their success, the reforms will need to be properly prioritized and sequenced, and the appropriate pace of implementation carefully assessed.""Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totaled $98 billion in 2015. The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.But it welcomed the government's spending controls and changes to domestic energy prices announced last December, saying: ""Fiscal policy is appropriately adjusting to the drop in oil prices."" The economy is expected to grow 1.2 percent this year, slowing from 3.5 percent in 2015, the Fund said.strong>DEFICIT FINANCING</strongThe IMF also said it approved of the way in which the government was financing its deficit with a combination of drawing down its financial reserves and issuing debt at home and abroad.The Fund has been encouraging some North African states to make their foreign exchange rates more flexible to cope with big current account deficits. But it took the opposite tack toward the external deficit which Saudi Arabia is running because of cheap oil, saying the riyal's peg to the U.S. dollar was continuing to serve the economy well.Market interest rates in Saudi Arabia have been rising sharply as the government borrows from banks to finance its deficit, with the three-month Saudi interbank offered rate SASAR3MD= jumping 135 basis points since mid-2015 to a multi-year high of 2.13 percent.But the IMF said the Saudi banking sector was strong and well-positioned to weather a slowing economy, and that tightening liquidity was not yet hurting credit growth.Two cornerstones of the Saudi reform plan are the sale of a stake of up to 5 percent in national oil giant Saudi Aramco, which could fetch tens of billions of dollars, and a build-up of the government's Public Investment Fund into a global investment vehicle.The IMF urged Riyadh to make both institutions more transparent and to integrate them into a new fiscal policy apparatus which the government is creating to make spending decisions more efficient.",2016-05-19,0.2,0.2,0.3618034381077858,0.09938609699479263
3817,High food prices challenge India inflation targ,"strong>MUMBAI: Prices of many foodstuffs such as pulses, sugar, vegetables and poultry products are set to surge in India in the next three months on thin supplies, which could fuel inflation and give the central bank little room to cut rates, said analysts.</strongApril consumer price inflation broke a recent slowing trend after food inflation came in at 6.32 percent, compared with 5.21 percent in March. Food prices are a political hot potato in India, where more than a quarter of their populations of 1.2 billion people live on a mere 74 cents or less per day.India is struggling with the first back-to-back drought in nearly three decades, which has ravaged crops, but expected good rains in the June-September monsoon season may boost production and food supplies later in the year.Indian farmers usually start sowing summer crops from June onwards and harvesting starts in October.""Good monsoon rainfall can lead to higher production, but new crops will be available for consumption only after few months,"" said Harish Galipelli, head of commodities and currencies at Inditrade Derivatives and Commodities.""Until we get the new crop, prices will remain elevated due to limited supplies.""Already the price of chickpea, the most consumed pulse in India, has risen over a quarter in a year, while sugar prices jumped 35 percent. Potato prices have doubled.Prices are likely to rise further as demand grows in coming months due to festivals like Ramadan, said Ashwini Bansod, a senior analyst at Phillip Commodities India Pvt Ltd.Rising prices could make it difficult for Reserve Bank of India Governor Raghuram Rajan to again cut interest rates.A fall in inflation to within targeted levels earlier this year allowed Rajan in April to cut rates to a more than five-year low.""With core inflation also sticky, headline inflation is therefore likely to stay at 5 percent or higher which makes it difficult for further rate cuts by the RBI,"" said Abhishek Upadhyay, economist at ICICI Securities Primary Dealership Ltd.Despite higher prices, farmers have been unable to cultivate vegetables due to higher temperatures and water scarcity.Water levels in the country's 91 major reservoirs have depleted to 19 percent of capacity as of May 12, compared to 31 percent a year ago.Many state governments like the western state of Maharashtra have cut water supplies for agriculture and reserved it for drinking purpose.""Every year in summer I cultivate vegetables.

Gold stumbled.</strongMSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.8 percent in early trade as the prospect of a second U.S. rate hike in six months raised concerns for emerging markets already grappling with a slowing China.South Korea and Australia led regional markets lower with 0.5 and 0.6 percent falls each as investors refocused their attention on the growing differences between the health of the world's biggest economy and its global counterparts.""In the short term, emerging markets are the most vulnerable,"" Steven Englander, global head of G10 FX strategy at Citibank wrote in a note to clients.""Overall, the divergence trade is revived until further notice,"" he wrote in a note to clients, saying the Canadian dollar and the Aussie were vulnerable due to concerns around those economies.Japan's Nikkei rose early thanks to a weaker yen, which fell to a three-week low against the dollar after minutes of the last Fed meeting suggested a rate increase is firmly on the table at its policy review next month. But the Nikkei later pared its gains to just 0.2 percent.The Fed minutes noted Fed officials said it would be appropriate to raise interest rates in June if economic data points to stronger second-quarter growth as well as firming inflation and employment.Such views helped revive the prospect of a rate hike in June, which had been dismissed by many investors.CME fed fund futures showed that the probability of a June rate increase by the Fed rose to 34 percent after the release of the FOMC minutes on Wednesday from 19 percent earlier in the day, 15 percent on Tuesday, and less than 1.0 percent a month ago, according to CME group's FedWatch.Still, many in the market are still skeptical the Fed would raise rates ahead of Britain's June 23 referendum on whether to remain in the European Union, a risk that was pointed out by some Fed policymakers. July may be a stronger possibility.The dollar index hovered just below a seven-week high of 95.27 scaled overnight, boosted by sharply higher U.S. Treasury yields.The benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield jumped more than 10 basis points on Wednesday while the yield curve steepened slightly, breaking a multi-month streak of flattening.The greenback was steady at a three-week high of 110.25 against the yen hit overnight.

Now it´s for Apple to talk about their plans,"" a close aide of Modi said.Cook´s first official visit to the country comes at a crucial time as Apple looks for new growth markets after posting its first-ever decline in iPhone sales.More than 100 million smartphones were sold in India last year and sales are expected to grow 25 percent this year, but Apple only has about a 2 percent share of the market.The company has been pushing the Indian government to allow it to import refurbished phones in the country, but that application was turned down earlier this month.A second source aware of the meeting said Cook asked Modi to reconsider the company´s plans to import refurbished phones  a strategy seen key for Apple to make affordable iPhones available in a country where most smartphone sell for less than $150.In an interview with NDTV channel on Friday, Cook said Apple plans to import second hand phones and refurbish them at a facility in India.Cook spent most of the week meeting heads of India´s largest companies, including telecom operator Bharti Airtel  and lender ICICI Bank, but also took out time to visit a temple, dine with Bollywood stars and watch cricket.Apple also announced plans to expand a software development centre it recently opened in Hyderebad and launched a program  for local developers working on its iOS platform.Modi and Cook also discussed cyber-security and data encryption, a government statement said.Apple has been at the centre of a debate on the role technology companies play in protecting data that led to a much-publicised dispute between Apple and the FBI over a phone linked to a shooting in San Bernardino, California.",2016-05-21,0.0,0.0,0.38167087542087547,0.09225589225589226

But it built up a backlog of payments when Iran was under sanctions.Modi is making a first trip to Iran since he took office in 2016, aimed at deepening energy ties.

3827,Abu Dhabi lays off staff Gulf austerity tig,"strong>ABU DHABI: Thousands of layoffs at state-linked companies in Abu Dhabi are a fresh sign the Gulf´s wealthy oil states are hunkering down for a long period of austerity as low crude prices pressure their economies.</strongSince mid-2015, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Saudi Arabia, Qatar and other countries in the region have curbed spending on some construction projects and reduced energy subsidies to limit budget deficits caused by cheap oil.Now some governments are also starting to reduce staff at the companies they control, many of them in the energy industry, in order to ensure the firms are not a drain on state finances if oil prices stay low for several years.Abu Dhabi´s National Oil Co (ADNOC), with around 55,000 staff, has cut hundreds of jobs in the last few months and will have reduced its workforce by at least 5,000 by the end of 2016, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters.The reduction will occur across most of its 17 subsidiaries as part of a restructuring following a reshuffle of the firm´s leadership this month, they said.An ADNOC spokesman did not confirm or deny the cuts but said: ""In keeping with the entire oil and gas industry, ADNOC is constantly looking at ways to be more efficient and more profitable, particularly in the current market environment.""The UAE´s oil and gas recruitment market is set for its most difficult year in over a decade in 2016, a report from recruiters Morgan McKinley said.""The oil and gas industry is still feeling the pain, as was to be expected. Overall redundancies have been on the increase,"" said Trefor Murphy, managing director for the region.Most layoffs at Abu Dhabi state firms are not in response to production cut-backs; the UAE has not reduced its oil output, and says it is proceeding with long-planned oil and gas development projects.Nor do the layoffs mean Abu Dhabi is running out of money.With hundreds of billions of dollars in its sovereign wealth fund, the emirate could draw down its reserves to sustain current levels of spending for decades.But the government wants to minimise the speed of the draw-down as it looks ahead to the possibility of many years of low oil prices.Last year, Abu Dhabi acted ahead of other Gulf States in cutting domestic fuel and electricity subsidies.Now it is applying the same approach to state-linked firms.In Qatar, state-controlled firms such as Qatar Petroleum and Qatar Rail have been laying off staff.State companies in other states such as Saudi Arabia and Oman have been looking at ways to reduce costs but have so far not resorted to major job cuts.strong>CUTS</strongMost cuts at state firms in Abu Dhabi and elsewhere involve foreign staff rather than locals, because governments want to limit unemployment among their citizens.Nevertheless, the job losses are contributing to an economic slowdown in the region.The International Monetary Fund has predicted Abu Dhabi´s gross domestic product growth will fall to 1.7 percent this year from 4.4 percent in 2015.In neighbouring Dubai, where the economy is not directly reliant on oil and state-linked firms are vigorously pushing tourism and real estate projects, growth is forecast to accelerate marginally, to 3.7 percent from 3.6 percent.Companies cutting staff in Abu Dhabi include Abu Dhabi National Energy Co, which has reduced its workforce by a quarter since 2014. It has cut around a third of oil and gas jobs and 55 percent of staff at its headquarters, it said this month after reporting a first-quarter loss.Earlier this year, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Rail, the federal government-owned entity building a UAE rail network, said it cut 30 percent of its staff in a restructuring.Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority laid off scores of people, mostly expatriates, sources said.Spokespeople for the authority did not return calls seeking comment.National Petroleum Construction Co, owned by Abu Dhabi´s state-owned industrial conglomerate Senaat and one of the largest oilfield contractors in Abu Dhabi, is reviewing its manpower levels, chief executive Aqeel Madhi told Reuters.Construction firm Arabtec, in which Abu Dhabi state fund Aabar Investments is the biggest shareholder, may include job cuts in its cost reduction programme, chairman Mohamed al-Rumaithi said last month, adding: ""There´s some fat to be taken out.""Some firms are axing expatriates to create jobs for UAE nationals.Medical centre operator Cleveland Clinic, owned by Abu Dhabi state fund Mubadala, is creating over 100 positions for locals, having told some expatriate staff they have to leave by year-end, sources said.Asked to comment, Cleveland said that as part of its efforts to develop local talent, a number of administrative roles would move to UAE citizens in coming months.",2016-05-22,0.0,0.0,0.38152281746031746,0.02822420634920634

And we all know where that ends up: higher prices in the shops,"" Cameron wrote in the Sun on Sunday newspaper.The warning comes from a government analysis of the short-term impact that a British exit would have on voters.He said the average family's weekly food and drink bill would rise by almost 3 percent, or 120 pounds ($174.06) per year, and that clothing and footwear costs would rise by 5 percent, or 100 pounds per year.The 'rival 'Out' campaign disputed the analysis. ""The EU pushes up the prices in our supermarkets because of its protectionist policies. That's ok for big business fat cats but it's not good for British families,' said Vote Leave Chief Executive Matthew Elliott.Six out of the last seven polls published in the last week have shown the Remain campaign in the lead, and on Saturday two major bookmakers offered the shortest odds to date on a vote to remain.On Friday Osborne warned, citing the same Treasury analysis, said house prices would fall if Britain left the EU.

A 10 percent reduction would cut acreage to around 10.5 million hectares in the 2016/17 marketing year starting July.Most Indian farmers begin cultivating soybean and pulses, which are rain-fed crops, in June after the arrival of the monsoon rains, and they are sown mainly in the states of Madhya Pradesh in central India, Maharashtra in the west, Rajasthan in the north-west, and Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka in the south.Dinesh Garg, a farmer from Morena in Madhya Pradesh, plants soybean during summer, but this year he has decided instead to cultivate red gram, better known locally as tuar.""Soybean is not remunerative due to lower prices. This year I am more interested in growing tuar,"" said Garg, who cultivated soybean on 5 hectares of land last year.Soybean production plunged 20 percent in 2015/16 to its lowest in more than a decade after drought and pests hit output.India exports soymeal mainly to Asian buyers, but the drop in production has forced it to import soymeal and soybean in small quantities for the first time in many years.Since the country imports most of its edible oil, limited soybean supply means imports will go up in 2016/17, said Faiyaz Hudani, associate vice-president, research, at Kotak Commodity Services Ltd.""Even though oilseed production is stagnant, edible oil consumption has been rising steadily due to growth in population and rising prosperity,"" Hudani said.India imports mainly palm oil from Indonesia and Malaysia, while it brings in soyoil from Argentina and Brazil.",2016-05-24,0.0,0.0,0.304041184041184,0.07739382239382239

3839,Iran Saudi threatens OPEC deal questi,"strong>LONDON/DUBAI: OPEC's thorniest dilemma of the past year - at least from a purely oil standpoint - is about to disappear.</strongLess than six months after the lifting of Western sanctions, Iran is close to regaining normal oil export volumes, adding extra barrels to the market in an unexpectedly smooth way and helped by supply disruptions from Canada to Nigeria.But the development will do little to repair dialogue, let alone help clinch a production deal, when OPEC meets next week amid rising political tensions between arch-rivals Iran and oil superpower Saudi Arabia, OPEC sources and delegates say.Earlier this year, Tehran refused to join an initiative to boost prices by freezing output but signaled it would be part of a future effort once its production had recovered sufficiently. OPEC has no supply limit, having at its last meeting in December scrapped its production target.According to International Energy Agency (IEA) figures, Iran's output has reached levels seen before the imposition of sanctions over its nuclear program. Tehran says it is not yet there.But while Iran may be more willing now to talk, an increase in oil prices has reduced the urgency of propping up the market, OPEC delegates say. Oil has risen toward a more producer-friendly $50 from a 12-year low near $27 in January.""I don't think OPEC will decide anything,"" a delegate from a major Middle East producer said. ""The market is recovering because of supply disruptions and demand recovery.""A senior OPEC delegate, asked whether the group would make any changes to output policy at its June 2 meeting, said: Nothing. The freeze is finished.Within OPEC, Iran has long pushed for measures to support oil prices. That position puts it at odds with Saudi Arabia, the driving force behind OPEC's landmark November 2014 refusal to cut supply in order to boost the market.Sources familiar with Iranian oil policy see no sign of any change of approach by Riyadh under new Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih - who is seen as a believer in reform and low oil prices.""It really depends on those countries within OPEC with a high level of production,"" one such source said. ""It does not seem that Saudi Arabia will be ready to cooperate with other members.""HIGHER EXPORTSIran has managed to increase oil exports significantly in 2016 after the lifting of sanctions in January.It notched up output of 3.56 million barrels of oil per day in April, the IEA said, a level last reached in November 2011 before sanctions were tightened.Saudi Arabia produced a near-record-high 10.26 million barrels per day in April and has kept output relatively steady over the past year, its submissions to OPEC show.Iran, according to delegates from other OPEC members, is unlikely to restrain supplies, given that it believes Saudi Arabia should cut back itself to make room for Iranian oil.""Iran won't support any freeze or cut,"" said a non-Iranian OPEC delegate. ""But Iran may put pressure on Saudi Arabia that they hold the responsibility.""Saudi thinking, however, has moved on from the days when Riyadh cut or increased output unilaterally. Talks in Doha on the proposed output freeze by OPEC and non-OPEC producers fell through after Saudi insisted that Iran participate.Indeed, differences between Saudi Arabia and Iran, which helped found the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries 56 years ago, over OPEC policy have made cooperation harder - to say nothing of more fundamental disagreements.For more than a decade after oil crashed to $10 in 1997, the two set aside rivalries to manage the market and support prices, although they fell into opposing OPEC camps with Iran wanting high prices and Saudi more moderate.Now, the Sunni-Shia conflicts setting Saudi Arabia and Iran at each other's throats, particularly in Syria and Yemen, make the relationship between the two even more fraught.The two disagree over OPEC's future direction. Earlier in May, OPEC failed to decide on a long-term strategy as Saudi Arabia objected to Iran's proposal that the exporter group aim for ""effective production management"".With that backdrop, ministers may be advised to keep expectations low, an OPEC watcher said.""The only aspiration OPEC should have for its 2 June meeting is simply not to repeat the chaos of the Doha process,"" said Paul Horsnell, analyst at Standard Chartered.""A straightforward meeting with no binding commitments and, most importantly, no overt arguments would be the best outcome for ministers.""",2016-05-25,0.0,0.0,0.39293821997211825,0.08862682515224887
3840,Gold near 7 week low Fed rate hike pr,"strong>BENGALURU: Gold dropped to a seven-week low on Wednesday, driven by expectations of an early interest rate hike by the U.S. Federal Reserve.</strongBullion has taken a beating from the prospect of an imminent rate increase, as indicated by Fed meeting minutes released last week. Gold is sensitive to interest rates, gains in which raise the opportunity cost of holding the non-interest-yielding asset.Spot gold was up 0.1 percent at $1,227.90 per ounce by 0317 GMT. The metal fell to $1,223 earlier in the session, its lowest since April 7.U.S. gold futures dipped 0.1 percent to $1,228.30.""I think gold prices will touch the $1,200-level in the coming few days. The change in rate hike expectations is still the major theme, but after the end of June the overall sentiment on the rate hike will be pretty much done,"" said Mark To, head of research at Hong Kong's Wing Fung Financial Group.Adding to the woes of the safe-haven bullion, the dollar stood near a two-month peak against a basket of major currencies on Wednesday after robust U.S. housing data supported the case for the Fed to raise rates in the near term.A stronger greenback makes dollar-denominated gold more expensive for holders of other currencies.The growing confidence towards a pick-up in U.S. economic growth got a boost on Tuesday as official data suggested new U.S. single-family home sales have hit the highest in eight years.The recent negative undertone for gold notwithstanding, some analysts believe a rate increase as early as June seems unlikely and would be discounted by traders, stabilising the yellow metal.""Despite the short term negative pullback, gold is still a strong 2016 performer against a range of alternative assets and these levels are an enticing entry price for long term bulls,"" MKS Group trader James Gardiner said.Holdings in SPDR Gold Trust, the world's largest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, fell 0.44 percent to 868.66 tonnes on Tuesday, the first decline in a month.Among other precious metals, spot silver rose 0.3 percent, to $16.25 an ounce. It dipped as low as $16.14 earlier in the session, its lowest in five weeks.Spot palladium fell 0.5 percent, to $529.50 an ounce, after hitting a twelve-week low of $528.97 earlier in the day.

3846,Mobile phones Step towards a connected futur,"The advent of mobile and smartphone technology has transformed the dynamics of communication in Pakistan. The adoption rates for smartphones are growing rapidly in both urban and rural centers. In 2015, 31% of mobiles purchased in the country were smartphones. Pakistan has approximately 80% mobile user penetration. These mobile phones have become so common that they are not considered a luxury device anymore but rather, an item of necessity. This technology has the potential to solve various day-to-day problems and the ability to lift people out of poverty. In fact, in the life of every individual, a mobile phone plays a critical role.   The reason behind a common man owning a phone can be attributed to price affordability and availability of quality smartphones within the reach of the masses. There are some big names is Pakistans smartphone market, but the role which Q Mobile has played for equipping the masses with mobile and smartphones has to be applauded. Q Mobile, which is the largest smartphone brand in Pakistan and enjoys a lion's share in the smartphone market, provides various kinds of phones such as smartphones, feature phones and tablets. It is clearly evident that, from a shopkeeper to a businessman, Q Mobile serves all Socio - Economic Classes.Once upon a time, these phones were used to send a message or receive a call but now, with all telecom operators providing affordable data services, the use of smartphones takes a completely new level of information.We now have access to mobile payment solutions, where we can send or receive money from distant areas within a fraction of seconds. We can shop online and pay via our mobile phones, connect with our loved ones living abroad via video calling, social networking and staying ever connected with all the news from around the world.Very soon, our farmers will check the daily commodity rate or inquire about delivery to the market. Long distance route truck drivers, who transport goods, can use online maps and GPS to plan their routes. Traders in the rural areas can narrow the gap with their buyers and sellers in urban areas by using mobile broadband. Health related services are also available via smartphones. A recent study by the Santa Fe Institute theorizes that cell phone use could help developing countries plan electrical infrastructure.With so much developments taking place, smartphones clearly represent a growing segment of our economy and are an example of how the availability of technology can propel Pakistan in the global marketplace while improving the lives of a common man at the same time.",2016-05-29,0.0,0.0,0.35248579545454545,-0.0009469696969697013

Market watchers pin the blame on a campaign against demonstrations of wealth among public officials, as well as a slowdown in economic growth.As things stand, the Chinese buy close to 80 percent of their luxury goods abroad in cities such as Paris, London and Tokyo, Bain Consultancy estimated.""Whether it is Burberry or Richemont recently, many brands in the space have noted that the future of luxury demand will be about the Chinese and incrementally at home,"" said HSBC analyst Erwan Rambourg in Hong Kong, who recommends buying CITS shares.strong>LESS CHOICE</strongIn Hainan, which is closer to Hanoi than Beijing, duty-free shops offering products priced as much as 30 percent less than the mainland have been operating since 2011, under a trial program aimed at developing the island as a tourist destination.Customers could initially only buy up to 8,000 yuan ($1,220) worth of duty-free goods, twice a year. From February 1, they have been able to make purchases any time of the year provided the total does not exceed 16,000 yuan. At the same time, stores have also been able to sell goods online for collection at airports.In Hainan's provincial capital Haikou in the north of the island, HNA's duty-free sales have since rocketed.In the island's city of Sanya, state-controlled CITS opened the country's first duty-free shopping centre in 2014.

It has already bid for 840 billion Indian rupees ($12.5 billion) in government contracts, senior executives said, though it hasn't yet won any of those.The success of the strategy will depend partly on whether he can persuade government officials and international partners that he can build sophisticated equipment and partly on whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi can get India's notoriously slow procurement process to work.Modi has made defence a big part of his ""Make in India"" programme. As part of any defence contract, he is demanding foreign companies tie up with a local partner, transfer technology and move some manufacturing to India.At stake is $250 billion in defence contracts the government is expected to award over the next 10 years as it looks to upgrade the military's aging equipment. ""We hope to have a significant share of this pie,"" said R K Dhingra, chief executive of Reliance Defence. He predicted the company will ""emerge as a key player in the defence sector over the next few years.""Reliance's ambition is greeted with scepticism by many in the defence world. An military official involved in defence procurement said Reliance is overreaching in wanting to make everything from ships to planes. Some rivals and potential partners for the contracts said Reliance will struggle to master the manufacture of such a wide range of sophisticated military hardware.""There is no quick money in this branch,"" said Jan Widerstrom, head of Saab India Technologies, a unit of Saab AB. ""It requires a lot of experience, high tech culture, investments and a long-term business plan.""Still, Saab and Reliance are working together in developing the next generation Combat Management System for the Indian Navy and Coast Guard.Recently, Reliance's lack of experience and questions about its ability to handle sensitive technology and intellectual property counted against it in its bid to partner with the Russians to build 200 Kamov helicopters, said a Russian diplomat in New Delhi, who declined to be identified in this story because they weren't speaking in an official capacity.The contract, estimated to be worth a little over $900 million went instead to Indian state-controlled company Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd.Ambani should identify core areas and concentrate on them rather than ""be an inch deep and a mile wide,"" said Nitin Gokhale, founder of defence website Bharat Shakti.strong>RELIANCE GROUP</strongThe Reliance conglomerate split into two in 2005 after a bitter feud between Anil Ambani and his older brother, Mukesh. The latter got the flagship Reliance Industries, with interests in petrochemicals, oil and gas exploration, refining and textiles.Anil got telecoms, power, entertainment and financial services businesses. But some of his businesses struggled, especially an ill-timed foray into infrastructure, and debt piled up.Its Reliance Infrastructure arm, which includes the defence operations, aims to be debt free in the current financial year ending March 2017, according to Lalit Jalan, who is acting CEO of the unit.To get there it plans to sell assets, including road projects and a stake in a power distribution company for about 180 billion rupees, according to another senior Reliance executive. Ambani entered the defence sector last year, when he took a controlling stake in a company that made warships and energy exploration vessels, in Modi's home state of Gujarat, called Pipavav Defence and Offshore Engineering Co Ltd, for about 20 billion Indian rupees.That became Reliance Defence and Engineering Ltd. Since then, Reliance has bought hundreds of acres of additional land to build an aerospace facility and another shipyard in other parts of the country.It has also signed more than half a dozen joint venture agreements with foreign companies, including one with Rafael Advanced Defence Systems of Israel, to bid for Indian government contracts as they come up.An Israeli defence industry source said for Rafael the idea is that if it wins tenders, Reliance will produce some components for missiles and other systems.strong>BUILDING EXPERIENCE</strongAmbani has said that lack of experience is being held against his company.""Despite a committed reformist mindset at the top, we are still seeing opportunities being denied to new players on grounds of lack of experience,"" Ambani told a 'Make in India' summit on defence in March.Reliance Defence has been building an experienced team. Dhingra earlier headed Lockheed Martin's India operations, and the company has hired a slew of senior army and navy officers who have executed large defence projects from conception to delivery, the Reliance executive said.The group's experience in managing complex projects in India, including building roads and power plants should help it, the executive said. For design, technology and complicated weaponry, Reliance would have a foreign partner, he noted.Reliance expects to spend up to 20 billion rupees over the next three years in upgrading facilities as it gets business, keeping its outlay low as it waits for contracts, the executive said.Thanks to its Pipavav shipyard, Reliance expects the naval part of its business to be the first to take off, he said. It plans to bid for a $7.5 billion submarine contract that the government is expected to give out to replace the navy's ageing and accident-prone fleet and narrow the gap with rival China's rapidly modernizing fleet.Ambani also has plans to bid for contracts in the future to make nuclear-powered submarines.($1 = 67.3 Indian rupees)",2016-05-30,0.1,0.0,0.3657523191094619,0.05079066171923314

3865,Budget prioritizes agriculture exports development to pr,"ISLAMABAD: After achieving economic stability, the focus of Budget 2016-17 would be on improving economic growth by prioritizing agriculture sector development and promotion of exports, said Finance Minister Senator Muhammad Ishaq Dar on Saturday.The Finance Minister stated this while addressing a crowded post budget press here at P Block Auditorium.He was flanked by Advisor to the Prime Minister on Revenues Haroon Akhhtar, Special Secretary to Finance Ministry Dr. Shuja Ali, Secretary Finance Dr.Waqar Masood Khan, Chairman Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) Nisar Muhammad Khan, Additional Secretary Finance Tariq Mehmood Pasha and senior officials of the Ministry of Finance.Ishaq Dar said that the two sectors which needed boost for the promotion of countrys Gross Domestic Product (GDP) were agriculture and exports.He said agriculture provides employment to 45 percent labour forces and 70 percent population is dependent on it while its share in national GDP is about 21 percent, adding negative growth of 0.19 in this sector and 28% reduction in cotton production did affect overall growth rate.He said that provision of relief to agriculture sector was the top most priority of the government so in the budget 2016-17, the prices of Urea fertilizers have been reduced by Rs. 400 per bag from Rs. 1800 to Rs.1400 while the prices of DAP has also been cut from 2800 to 2500 providing 300 relief to farmers.He said the agriculture package announced in the federal budget was devised in consultations with farmers representatives, chambers of commerce and other stakeholders.He said that sales tax on pesticides have also been zero rated while the per unit electricity charges for tube wells has been reduced from Rs.8.85 plus sales tax to Rs.5.35 adding that the provinces have been requested to adjust sales tax keeping in consideration to provide relief to farmers.The Minister said that the second priority sector for boosting growth was to promotion of exports.He said that due to fall in commodity prices in the international market the exports from the county witnessed decline in terms of cost, however the exports of different commodities increased in terms of quantity.He said that Pakistan aimed at enhancing ratio of exports to GDP which is about 15 percent or US 45 billion in emerging economies.He informed that in July this year Pakistan Stock Exchange was likely to be accepted by the international stock market as a frontier market.He said the government was all set to launch Pakistan Microfinance Company which would have potential of providing microfinance facility to 25 million people and would also help in creation of 300 000 new jobs.Moreover, he said when the countrys economic growth would cross 7 per cent, a huge number of new jobs would also be created due to increase in economic activities in the country. ",2016-06-05,0.0,0.0,0.3502299783549783,0.08978625541125541
3866,Saudi economic diversification plan finalised,"JEDDAH, Saudi Arabia: Saudi officials have finalised a detailed plan to diversify the country´s economy away from oil and have sent it for cabinet approval, official media said on Monday.The National Transformation Programme (NTP) will elaborate upon Vision 2030, an 84-page document released in April by Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 30, who is leading the reform charge.At the heart of the Vision is a plan to float less than five percent of state oil firm Saudi Aramco on the stock market.The proceeds would become part of the world´s largest state investment fund, with $2 trillion in assets.Profits from the investment fund would help economic diversification and provide an alternative to oil revenues that have fallen by about half since 2014.The collapse has accelerated Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum which still accounts for the bulk of government income.The main economic coordinating body, the Council of Economic Affairs and Development chaired by Prince Mohammed, on Sunday night decided to submit the ""final version"" of the NTP to the cabinet for approval, the Saudi Press Agency said.The cabinet normally meets on Mondays. A press conference is expected in the Red Sea city of Jeddah, the summer home of the government, on Monday night.According to Vision 2030, the NTP relates to the government´s role ""in implementing the initiatives necessary for delivering on national priorities.""It said opportunities for partnering with the private sector were being looked at, ""as well as innovative administrative and funding approaches. We are detailing specific initiatives that have clear performance indicators.""Among its wide-ranging goals the Vision aims to reduce unemployment, increase women´s participation in the workforce, boost private sector economic contributions, and develop cultural and entertainment activities in the kingdom.Saudi Arabia is one of the world´s most conservative societies, but more than half of its citizen population is younger than 25.",2016-06-06,0.2,0.2,0.4036666666666666,0.11666666666666665

But energy prices have plummeted since mid-2014, causing steep declines in income and putting growth at risk.HIGH PROFILEThe wider reforms are expected to include subsidy cuts, tax rises, sales of state assets, a government efficiency drive and efforts to spur private sector investment. Last month the International Monetary Fund said the plans were ""appropriately bold and far reaching"".Details of the plan, a programme of wide-ranging economic reforms, will be disclosed in daily news conferences with government ministers starting Monday evening, the senior source said.Other parts of the Vision 2030, including a partial privatisation of state oil giant Saudi Aramco and transformation of the government's Public Investment Fund into one of the world's biggest sovereign wealth funds, have yet to be approved.The emphasis placed on the plan by Prince Mohammed is evident in the high-profile nature of its launch, with senior ministers expected to deliver rare briefings on how their departments will implement the programme.The timing is also significant because Monday is the first day of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan, when business and government activity in the conservative Islamic kingdom have historically slowed down. Launching the plan despite the start of the holiday signals a more energetic approach.Riyadh has been cutting spending and trying to raise fresh revenues as it grapples with its budget deficit, which totalled $98 billion in 2015.The IMF predicted the deficit would stay very large this year, at about 14 percent of gross domestic product compared to 16 percent last year.",2016-06-06,0.35,0.35,0.38997206497206505,0.09489861989861988

They were pricing in about 60 percent chances of a rate hike by July before Friday's weak payrolls data.On the other hand, they continue to price in one rate hike by the end of year.Still, diminishing prospects of the Fed tightening policy anytime soon underpinned share prices.U.S. S&amp;P 500 Index closed up 0.49 percent to 2,109.41, just about one percentage point below record closing high of 2,130.82.World equity markets were higher, and MSCI's all-country world equity index rose 0.53 percent for a third straight gaining session to a six-week high on Monday.The dollar briefly dipped following Yellen's comments, though it pared much of its losses by early Asian trade.The dollar index hit a four-week low of 93.745 before bouncing back to 94.037.The euro eased to $1.1356 after having scaled a four-week high of $1.3930 while the yen also stepped back to 107.545 per dollar from Monday's five-week high of 106.35.The Australian dollar changed hands at $0.7371, below Monday's four-week peak of $0.7392 ahead of the Reserve Bank of Australia's policy decision at 0430 GMT.The central bank is widely expected to keep rates on hold after a rate cut last month.The British pound hovered above Monday's three-week low but with various polls showing support for ""Brexit"" almost neck-and-neck with ""remain"" camp, implied volatilities on pound options are soaring.The pound traded at $1.4459, off its low of $1.4352 touched in early Asian trade on Monday.

Traders may increase the export of sugar to make profit,"" Paswan tweeted on Thursday evening.Traders and experts said the new tax could push up global sugar prices, even though India was already expected to become a net importer in the year from Oct. 1 following back-to-back drought years.""Since we are the world's second largest sugar producer there could be a 5 percent impact on global prices but not more,"" said Aurobinda Prasad, vice president research, Kotak Commodities.India exported 2.9 million tonnes of sugar in 2015/16, accounting for 5.3 percent of world exports, according to U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures.In a May report, the USDA already forecast sharply reduced exports from India this year of just 1 million tonnes, which would be the lowest since the 2009/10 crop year.""With rising white sugar prices and the weakening rupee, Indian mills could have signed export deals with Sri Lanka.

Islamic trade finance, which follows religious principles such as a ban on interest, accounts for only a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars of bank-intermediated trade finance conducted globally every year.But the ITFC, which uses its expertise and funds to facilitate Islamic trade finance, says it is expanding its activities partly through new business with countries outside the traditional core areas of sharia-compliant finance in the Gulf and southeast Asia.Last month, it signed financing agreements with Djibouti, Comoros, Mali and Mauritania, and is exploring transactions in Guyana, the newest member of the IDB Group, Sonbol said. The ITFC approved transactions worth $6.1 billion in the financial year to last October, up from $5.2 billion a year earlier. It more than doubled financing approvals to sub-Saharan Africa; Egypt, Pakistan and Turkey saw some of the biggest individual increases in approvals.Difficulties in the global economy could dampen further growth but the ITFC aims for around $7 billion of approvals this year, Sonbol said.Traditionally, Islamic banks have not become heavily involved in trade financing as it often requires large balance sheets; they have left such business for Western banks to dominate.To overcome this, the ITFC has developed a network of more than 70 financial institutions which last financial year provided $4.2 billion via 25 syndicated deals, representing 68 percent of the institution´s total trade financing.The rest came from its own resources. Strategic partnerships are growing: Last year, the ITFC closed a $350 million export syndication in favour of Turkey´s export-import bank, and in February it signed a partnership agreement with Morocco´s largest lender by assets, Attijariwafa Bank.The ITFC´s mandate is to promote trade among countries of the 57-member Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). Trade within the group accounted for 19.5 percent of OIC countries´ total trade in 2015, up from around 12 percent in 2011, and the ITFC aims for 26 percent by 2025, Sonbol said.The IDB is the largest shareholder in the ITFC with 37.6 percent of paid-up capital; Saudi Arabia holds second place with 16.9 percent.<br/> Last year, the ITFC´s general assembly approved an increase of Iran´s subscription by 8,500 shares, which once paid would allow it to take third spot behind Saudi Arabia.",2016-06-12,0.0,0.0,0.3219459402386231,0.053674374406081714

For the next two weeks, you've got to be slightly mad if you've not got your money in defensive stocks.""The news out of China, global investors' other big concern this year, was also poor, with data showing investment growth cooling.

Britain's FTSE 100 fell 1 percent, Germany's DAX 0.9 percent, and France's CAC 40 by 0.8 percent.On currency markets, sterling fell another half a percent against the dollar after sinking by as much as 3 full cents in value on Friday.

Electricity shortages were among the main election issues in the 2013 poll won by Sharif.ADB is lending Pakistan more than $1 billion over five years as part of efforts to end chronic energy crisis and implement reforms such as privatising parts of the sector and improving transparency.Werner Liepach, ADB's country director for Pakistan, said the bank was ""broadly satisfied about progress being made"" in Pakistan with energy sector reforms.When asked at a news conference if load shedding could be eradicated in two years, Liepach was categorical: ""Yes"". He added it was possible to be done even sooner but it would depend on other factors, such as global oil prices.Sharif's government has made reducing energy shortages a top priority, embarking on construction of new dams, coal-fire power plants and renewable energy projects.Energy Minister Khawaja Asif said the South Asian nation had last week hit record production generation of 17,350 megawatts (MW), though production shortfalls varied between 1,500MW and 4,700MW through the week.",2016-06-20,0.0,0.0,0.3987967914438502,0.10459001782531194

3888,rising economy Pakistan hampered image prob,"strong>KARACHI/ISLAMABAD: Pakistani stocks are soaring, improved security is fuelling economic growth and the South Asian nation will be upgraded to ""emerging market"" status by index provider MSCI.</strongBut for Ali Saigol, co-founder of a private equity firm, convincing foreign investors to overlook the country's violent past and bet on its economy remains a hard sell. He said pitches often encountered the same problem: Pakistan's image.After a turbulent decade in which Islamist militants staged frequent gun and bomb attacks on cities, some investors still refuse to visit Pakistan and insist on meeting Saigol in Dubai.""Most people have never been to Pakistan. It's a huge problem,"" said Saigol, sipping a cappuccino in an upscale cafe in Islamabad, Pakistan's leafy, affluent capital.""When people visit Pakistan, they see it's actually opposite of what they expect.""Saigol's frustration goes to the heart of Pakistan's struggle to attract foreign investment and boost economic growth from 4.7 percent towards above 6 percent, the minimum level experts say is needed to absorb new entrants into the job market in a nation of 190 million people.Pakistan's $250 billion economy is growing at the fastest pace in eight years but only attracted $1 billion in foreign direct investment (FDI) in the nine months to April. FDI inflows into Indonesia, by comparison, hit $29 billion last year.Many businesses in Pakistan have flourished since 2014, when a military offensive against Islamist groups improved security.Violence is down overall, although deadly attacks are not uncommon. In late March, more than 60 mostly women and children were killed by a suicide bomber in Lahore.In major cities, car sales are rising and shopping malls are sprouting to cater for an expanding middle class.A crime crackdown in Karachi, Pakistan's financial hub of 20 million people, has helped spur a real estate boom and new, upmarket seaside restaurants and cafes are overflowing.strong>PERCEPTIONS TAKE TIME TO CHANGE</strongThe progress is in stark contrast to economic instability during the past decade, when the stock market collapsed and Pakistani Taliban militants held territory 100km from Islamabad.The militants have since been contained in small pockets in mountainous areas near the Afghan border and the country's stock market is Asia's best performing index in 2016.""Perceptions change with a lag. Our reality has changed, but it takes a little while for investors to realise that,"" said Miftah Ismail, an adviser to the prime minister tasked with bringing foreign investment into Pakistan.Ismail said he had expected more money to flow from abroad by now, and concedes investors need convincing that Pakistan ""will not revert to type"" by running large deficits and facing foreign exchange crises.Investors will also have to be convinced that political risks are easing in a nuclear-armed nation surrounded by countries with whom it has unstable relations, including arch-foe India.Yet there are tentative signs foreign companies are eyeing Pakistan's fast-growing consumer market.Carmakers Renault-Nissan are considering a plant in Pakistan, and Suzuki, which already has a presence, said it may invest $460 million for a new factory.A Dutch dairy cooperative, FrieslandCampina International Holding, in March announced plans to buy a stake in Pakistani food giant Engro Foods, in a deal estimated at $460 million.strong>INDICATORS ""FLASHING GREEN""</strongOmar Hamid, head of Asia Pacific country risk research for IHS, said interest in Pakistan has soared this year by IHS corporate clients seeking country and political risk analysis.""It's a massive consumer market and the economic indicators are flashing green for many international companies,"" he said.Pakistan's interest rates are at 42-year lows, inflation has been tamed at about 3 percent, the currency is stable and foreign exchange reserves have jumped to all-time highs.The economy is also expected to receive a shot in the arm from the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a $46 billion roads and energy project.Much of the money is earmarked for power stations to ease chronic electricity shortages which hobble business and investment.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government is so confident about the economy that it plans to end the IMF's $6.7 billion financial assistance programme in September. Analysts say this could prove a risky move if oil prices spike.In Karachi, the business community hopes MSCI's upgrade of Pakistan will herald a return of foreign investors who fled in anger in 2008 when the bourse imposed a floor and trapped them in a collapsing market for three months.""What happen in 2008 could never happen again,"" said Haroon Askari, deputy director of the Pakistan Stock Exchange.Pakistan's main benchmark index has risen more than 500 percent since the start of 2009, but is still considered cheap by some, trading at multiples below other emerging markets due to political and security risks associated with Pakistan.Saigol, founding partner of Baltoro Capital, which manages a new $48.5 million private equity fund, said foreign investors who finally take a serious look at Pakistan are often surprised.""They say they have never seen a country or an economy the size of Pakistan with so little coverage, so under the radar.""",2016-06-20,0.0,0.0,0.3735393905036761,0.028075611557754405

The senior management is required to ensure that an organizational plan of action for cyber security management exists in each institution and is regularly reviewed and updated for implementation.It may be noted here that cyber threats have become a global phenomenon and are continually growing in sophistication and impact, despite the advances in cyber-security technologies and practices.SBP has always proactively strived to provide an enabling regulatory framework in order to cope with new threats. While the new technologies and their application in banking system has created new opportunities for the efficient and cost-effective delivery of services, these have also posed a number of new threats and risks.The banks/DFIs/MFBs are required to make necessary arrangements to comply with the instructions latest by December 31, 2016.",2016-06-23,0.0,0.0,0.3377497502497503,0.0987012987012987

In that case, Dublin was concerned that the negotiation on a form of border would be done at EU level and therefore not entirely under its control.The fear for many is that any new border restrictions could endanger an 18-year-old peace agreement between Catholic Irish nationalists seeking a united Ireland and their Protestant rivals who want to keep Northern Ireland British.""At best, I would point to a period of uncertainty that would affect the great progress that has been made (in Northern Ireland) in recent years,"" Flanagan said in his office in Dublin's government buildings.""And in terms of the peace process, any re-introduction of border controls, either in terms of custom controls for trade or in terms of security, that could well pose us with a difficult challenge.""",2016-06-23,0.125,-0.125,0.3510858585858586,0.09837436868686869

3898,Pound Asia markets collapse as Britain quits EU,"Hong Kong: The pound collapsed to a 31-year low and there was pandemonium on currency, equity and oil markets Friday as Britain voted to leave the European Union, fuelling a wave of global uncertainty.Sterling crashed 10 percent to $1.3229 at one point, its weakest level since 1985, while the greenback itself slumped below 100 yen for the first time in two-and-a-half years as traders fled to safety.In the weeks leading up to Thursday´s historic vote, there had been widespread warnings that a ""Brexit"" would cause a rout across global markets that would wipe trillions off valuations, just months after a painful China-fuelled sell-off.The doomsday scenario appeared to be playing out as markets suffered one of their worst days since the 2008 financial crisis after final results confirmed one of the EU´s big three economies would leave the bloc after four decades.Fears are also growing that other EU members will push for referendums, posing the biggest threat to the future of grouping since its inception almost 60 years ago.The pound had earlier topped $1.50 following predictions the ""remain"" group would win, but as the Brexit camp posted early victories around the country, traders stampeded to put in sell orders. In Asian afternoon trade it was at $1.3387.""Leave´s victory has delivered one of the biggest market shocks of all time,"" said Joe Rundle, head of trading at ETX Capital. ""The reverberations of the vote will be felt around the world.""The extent of the damage on asset prices is hard to gauge but it´s likely to be bigger than anything since Lehmans at the very least,"" he added, referring to the Wall Street bank whose collapsed precipitated the global financial crisis.The dollar slumped briefly to 99.02 yen, the first time it has gone below 100 yen since November 2013, before edging back up above 101 yen.

Foreign dignitaries, including the presidents of Taiwan, Chile, and other Central American nations, will be present at the ceremony.A Chinese-owned Neopanamax-class cargo ship will be the first vessel to officially test the new infrastructure, entering from the Atlantic and exiting into the Pacific a few hours later.The Neopanamax vessels are much bigger than the Panamax-class ships that previously were the largest able to pass through the 80-kilometer (50-mile) long canal. Each is able to haul three times as much cargo as the smaller predecessors.The expansion work began in 2007 and was meant to have been completed in 2014, but it ran well past deadline, and over budget.The expansion is estimated to have cost $5.5 billion. But there are outstanding disputes between the Spanish- and Italian-led consortium that carried out the work and the Panamanian government that could hike that figure by hundreds of millions more.<br/> <br/> For Panama, the unveiling of the broader canal is a moment of pride and of opportunity.Now, ships as long as the Eiffel Tower is tall, and as broad as Olympic-sized swimming pools, will be able to use the canal.Annual cargo volumes should double over the next decade, leading Panama to hope to triple the $1 billion in shipping fees it receives each year.Also, with the country these days linked to the ""Panama Papers"" scandal of offshore businesses owned by the world´s wealthy and influential, the expanded canal is seen as a chance to burnish the country´s tarnished image.This will show the ""real face of Panama,"" the head of the Panama Canal Authority, Jorge Quijano told AFP in an interview this week.World trade should also benefit from what will essentially be an inter-oceanic highway for goods between the United States and Asia. More cargo on bigger ships should mean lower transport costs.Panama is also avidly eying the lucrative market of transporting liquefied natural gas between the United States and Asia, principally to Japan.The ships carrying the gas were too big to use the old canal.

But investors again shunned the pound and sought the safety of government bonds.UK money and bond markets moved to price in lower interest rates, with swaps rates now almost fully implying a 0.25 percentage-point cut from the BoE by the end of the year.The yield on 10-year UK government bonds tumbled as much as 15 basis points to a new low of 0.933 percent, and two-year yields fell more than 10 basis points to a four-year low of 0.129 percent.The 10-year yield has fallen 44 basis points since Thursday, its biggest two-day fall since March 2009.""You'd have expected there to be some psychological barrier to gilts breaking through 1 percent, but not today,"" said Luke Hickmore, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Asset Management.""Gilt yields just kept dropping.

A fiscal consolidation drive to improve federal finances has constrained the federal government from carrying out important reforms related to the public sector enterprises, including a reduction in contingent liabilities from pensions and other related costs. Among enterprises that need immediate financial support for initiating important reforms are power distribution companies and Pakistan Railways.The full program will help the government draw up and roll out a comprehensive reform plan to improve the financial transparency of public sector enterprises and to strengthen their corporate governance. It will include support to establish a retirement cost fund to manage huge unfunded pensions and other retirement liabilities of workers. Unfunded pension risk presents a serious threat to the financial health of the enterprises.Measures to strengthen auditing, accounting and other elements of operations at Pakistan Railways will also be supported by the program, along with actions to improve the performance of federal financial sector entities to boost financial inclusion in the country.The program is part of a broader, coordinated donors package for public sector enterprise reforms, with other assistance being provided by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. The program loans will be extended in two equal subprograms of $300 million each, with the first subprogram running for a year to June 2017 and the full program finishing in June 2018.ADB, based in Manila, is dedicated to reducing poverty in Asia and the Pacific through inclusive economic growth, environmentally sustainable growth, and regional integration.

3910,Pakistans cotton imports record highs output dwind,"strong>MUMBAI: Cotton imports by Pakistan are expected to remain near record-high levels in the year to July 2017, as erratic weather forces farmers in the world´s fourth-biggest producer to trim area under the crop, industry officials said.</strongA supply crunch in Pakistan, at a time when back-to-back droughts have taken a toll on output at top producer India, could boost global cotton prices from their current near 11-month highs.The two countries have already taken turns this year to buy from each other to fill shortages at home.""Cotton area in Pakistan is down around 15 percent. Despite the government and industry´s efforts, farmers in top-producing Punjab have reduced area,"" said Saleem Saleh, acting secretary general of All Pakistan Textile Mills Association (APTMA).Unpredictable weather, such as floods late last year as well as poor rainfall in recent months, and the resultant uncertainty about yields is putting many farmers off cotton, stymieing Pakistan´s efforts to boost local output.""Farmers are finding other crops profitable,"" said Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginner´s Association.The country´s cotton output fell by a third to 9.7 million bales in 2015/16, forcing it to import a record 4 million bales in the year, up from 1.2 million a year ago, according to APTMA.Pakistan annually consumes around 15 million.Even for the season starting Aug. 1, weather has not been supportive and the crop in Punjab has already been hurt by poor rains in May and June, said Khan.Cotton sowing in Pakistan starts from April and harvesting begins in July.While the country has set a production target of 14.1 million bales for the new season, industry officials say output will fall short and that rainfall over the next few weeks will be crucial in determining yields.""Import requirement is rising as local consumption is rising, but production is stagnant.This year imports jumped due to crop failure. Next year also imports would remain around this year´s level.

3946,Nintendos market cap doubles to 42 billion since Pokemon GO lau,"strong>TOKYO: Shares of Japan's Nintendo Co soared another 14 percent on Tuesday, more than doubling the firm's market capitalisation to 4.5 trillion yen ($42.5 billion) in just seven sessions since the mobile game Pokemon GO was launched in the United States.</strongThe phenomenal success of Pokemon GO - now available in 35 countries, the majority in Europe, and most recently in Canada - has triggered massive buying in Nintendo shares, surprising even some seasoned market players.""I've never seen the trend of such a big company's shares changing so quickly in such a short period of time,"" said Takashi Oba, senior strategist at Okasan Securities.Nintendo shares ended Tuesday up 14.4 percent at 31,770 yen, bringing its gains to more than 100 percent since the launch of the game on July 6.Turnover in Nintendo shares hit 703.6 billion yen, surpassing the record for trading turnover in individual shares it set on Friday, of 476 billion yen.Trading in Nintendo shares roughly accounted for a quarter of the entire trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange's main board.The success of Pokemon GO, unforeseen even by its creators, has boosted hopes that Nintendo could capitalise on a line-up of popular characters ranging from Zelda to Super Mario to strengthen its new foray into augmented reality.""Virtual reality and augmented reality have been a focus of the market but hardly anyone was expecting Nintendo in this area. Suddenly Nintendo has become an AR-related stock,"" said a fund manager at a Japanese asset management firm, who declined to be named as he is not allowed to discuss individual shares.The fund manager said the big gains were justifiable considering the likely boost to Nintendo's bottom line.""Under my rough estimate, the sales from Pokemon GO and upcoming related gadgets will boost net profits by 50 billion yen. Based on that assumption, Nintendo is traded at 30 times profits, which is not unreasonable,"" he said.The popularity of Pokemon GO is producing an unexpected boom in some shares that have a scant link to the game.Shares in First Baking Co, a bakery firm with annual sales of 25 billion yen, saw its shares rise 18 percent on Tuesday as the firm sells ""Pokemon Bread"" among other breads wrapped with character-decorated bags.",2016-07-19,0.0,0.0,0.4257386363636364,0.08299242424242423

Hence, they might seek blessings by promising to donate shares to the temple,"" he said.The temple trust decided to pursue the scheme after another temple in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh last year became the first to accept stocks as donations, Rane added.The trust uses donations to finance charitable hospitals and schools for underprivileged societies across India´s western Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital.",2016-07-20,0.0,0.0,0.28214285714285714,0.12857142857142856
3948,Gold glisters diamonds hedge the ri,"strong>GENEVA/LONDON: In a packed Christie's auction room in Geneva, one could hear a pin drop as two anonymous bidders slugged it out in their quest to own the world's most exquisite blue diamond.</strongThe room in the Four Seasons Hotel des Bergues was filled with multi-millionaire collectors and diamond dealers, listening intently as the bidders, each speaking by phone to a Christie's representative, took turns adding a few hundred thousand dollars in a tense struggle dragging on for more than half an hour.When the auctioneer's hammer came down, spontaneous applause broke out as the winner, who retained anonymity, bought the 14.62-carat Oppenheimer Blue for a world record $57.5 million for any jewel sold at auction. The sale some weeks ago was the latest in a series of world record prices per carat paid at auction for extraordinarily magnificent and rare diamonds.With new fortunes being created around the world faster than at any time in history, more of this expanding elite of wealthy investors are looking at different ways of protecting cash that now earns close to zero percent interest in bank accounts, while asset market turbulence can wipe out millions in hours.Some are eyeing rare diamonds as a best friend, or long-term haven at least. And it's no longer just a top table of ""super rich"" billionaires who are gravitating to this arcane world.A second division of wealthy is emerging. They can't afford the Oppenheimer Blue, perhaps, but they can take a stake in rare diamonds via specialist investment funds.strong>PROFESSIONAL INVESTORS' CLUB ONLY</strongThese gem specialists are keen to play up rare diamonds as ""safety"" investments, or at least a way to hedge against currency, stock and bond market volatility at a time of political and economic uncertainty. Britain's shock vote last month to leave the European Union underlines their point.""The big players are looking at diamonds in a different way,"" said Ehud Laniado, chief executive of Cora International, which sold the 12.03-carat Blue Moon diamond for $48.4 million at a Sotheby's Geneva sale in November, a world record for any jewel sold at auction at the time.""They are not looking at them just as a jewel, but as an asset that has a resale value.""Citigroup said the outlook for gold remained uncertain partly due to concerns about a possible increase in U.S. interest rates. In such a scenario, investors may look at a next-best alternative such as diamonds.However, the diamond investors' club is shut to most ordinary savers due to its complicated, insider nature - characterised by poor liquidity, a lack of price transparency and high fees. While some are making efforts to create a liquid market, the process has been slow.Entry level for Sciens Coloured Diamond Fund II, one of the more established closed-end funds now shut to new investors, is $1 million. It invests in diamonds in rare colours such as red.The fund, which manages around $50 million, uses trading and buy-and-hold strategies for long-term appreciation. One of its strategies is to improve the value of stones by finding a rare matching pair in the same colour, size and shape. They are eventually sold to buyers such as jewellers and collectors.Some funds also loan diamonds to jewellers who wish not to maintain a large inventory. If the jeweller decides to make a unique ring for a client, he can buy a diamond from the fund.The Sciens fund, launched in 2014, rose in value by about 5 percent in the second quarter of 2016, said Philip Baldwin, managing director of Sciens Diamond Management BV. He and Mahyar Makhzani run the fund, based on the Caribbean island of Curacao.""Colour diamonds are considered a safe haven,"" he said. ""Colour diamonds are a hedge against inflation, currency risk, market fluctuations and political uncertainty.""Solitaire Diamond Co, another diamond-backed fund now closed to new investors, is backed by an assortment of white diamonds of high-grade clarity and cut weighing under 5 carats, which are certified by international laboratories such as the Gemological Institute of America.Fred Sinclair-Brown, Solitaire fund manager, said it made a gross margin of 20 percent over the past 12 months, above expectations of 14 to 16 percent. He said he was planning another diamond fund for professional investors, this time possibly backed by coloured gems.strong>INVESTORS SEE SPARKLE IN COLOUR GEMS</strongPrices of vivid and intense colour diamonds have risen 10 to 12 percent a year on average since 1959, according to Baldwin. However, dealers said white diamond prices had not gained as quickly in recent years and were largely flat in 2016.The most prominent white diamond to come to auction recently, the 1,109-carat Lesedi la Rona, failed to sell at Sotheby's in London last month, highlighting that diamond markets are not bulletproof.Diamond markets slowed in the second quarter as selective buyers pushed for deeper discounts. Polished inventory continued to rise and prices came under pressure, while rough trading remained resilient.Despite a handful of diamond-backed initiatives, fund managers have struggled over the years to find the right investment vehicles for diamonds due to illiquidity, a lack of price transparency and high transaction fees.""I am very dubious about diamond-backed investment because the price of diamonds is not listed anywhere and the market is too illiquid,"" said Edmund Shing, strategist at BNP Paribas and former global equity fund manager of BCS Asset Management.Fund managers pointed to very separate markets for white diamonds. While white diamonds can be correlated to the commercial market for bridal jewellery, colour gems are in a unique investment category. Part of the problem with diamond investing is that different categories make it difficult to compile generic prices.A recent Citigroup poll found that about one-third of the respondents were willing to invest in a diamond product having homogeneity and liquidity.Martin Rapaport, head of the Rapaport Group, which has its own polished diamond price list widely used by the trade, is trying to create a more liquid market for investment-grade diamonds by developing a transparent price structure. He hopes to launch a fund backed by diamonds within a couple of years.""Diamonds can be a good investment, but you have to be careful,"" he told Reuters. ""You need to know the bid/ask spread, the price you can sell diamonds back on the same day.""",2016-07-20,0.0,0.0,0.4492062168208956,0.1280446668520063

Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.strong>WINNING FORMULA</strongSouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC.

3997,Sales Tax initiatives check huge tax evasi,"strong>ISLAMABAD: The newly introduced sales tax automation system would help generate additional billions of rupees for the national exchequer besides ensuring transparency discipline and proper monitoring of sales and purchase all across the country.</strongThe Sales Tax Real time Invoice Verification Strive System has been put in place to check leakages in the tax system and improve overall revenue collections, Member Sales Tax Dr. M. Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages, he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",2016-08-12,0.9,0.4000000000000001,0.3634111384111384,0.08431613431613431

4003,British shoppers begin feel post Brexit pi,"strong>LONDON: From computers and cars to carpets and food, Britain´s decision to leave the EU is beginning to hit consumers in the pocket, having already spread uncertainty through the property market.</strongThe consequences of the shock vote have so far been mainly theoretical, but recent data suggest that the country´s tumbling currency is about to reach the High Street.The pound has lost 10 to 15 percent of its value against the euro and the dollar since the June 23 referendum, raising the price of goods primarily supplied by foreign companies such as automobiles, computers, clothing and some foods.Carmaker Peugeot told AFP that it had raised prices by an average of two percent since August 1 for models of its three flagship brands: Peugeot, Citroen and DS.Similarly, Dell computer group said it now had to factor the cost of components, denominated in dollars, into the price of its products in Britain.British group Headlam explained that the pound´s plunge had also increased the cost of its domestic floor coverings, imported mainly from Belgium and the Netherlands, by around six percent.All eyes are now turning to food and property, which have been relatively unscathed, but which many fear could see similar price fluctuations.Fierce competition among supermarkets desperate to maintain market share normally provides a bulwark against sharp inflation in food prices, but Brexit could rewrite the rules, said Fraser McKevitt, an analyst at Kantar group´s London office.""We wouldn´t expect to see anything come through immediately, but if sterling does remain weak, we are likely to see impact on some prices,"" he told AFP.""Around 40 percent of food in the UK is imported.""strong>- Diluted purchasing power -</strongPrice comparison website mysupermarket.com has already reported an increase of one percent in the price of an average basket of supermarket goods in July, blaming ""fears of Brexit"" for the second consecutive month of price hikes.There are also fears over the UK housing market, but deflation is more of a concern than price rises in this key sector.Figures released Monday showed that residential rents for new lets in London had fallen for the first time in six years, according to the first study published on the issue since Britain voted to leave the European Union.While good news for tenants, it will leave landlords worse off.In addition, homeowners have seen the value of their property rise on average by just 2.1 percent in the year up tol August, a slowdown from the breakneck growth of recent years, according to property website Rightmove.Despite Brexit´s tremors being felt in the economy, official figures do not yet reveal wild price fluctuations, reporting only a slight rise in inflation of 0.6 percent in July.But experts expect stronger inflation growth over the next few months, boosted by the increased costs of imported goods and more volatile goods such as alcoholic drinks.The Bank of England has also deployed monetary weapons in an attempt to stop the economy sliding into recession, which are expected to increase the money supply and as a result boost inflation and further weaken the pound.Britons hoping for a pay rise to compensate for increased costs are likely to be disappointed, according to analysts.""It looks probable that consumer purchasing power will be significantly diluted over the coming months as inflation trends higher and earnings growth is limited,"" warned Howard Archer from IHS Global Insight.""Companies may well look to clamp down on workers´ pay as they strive to save costs in a more difficult environment.""Workers lucky enough to see a rise in their salary thanks to a fall in low-skilled immigration are unlikely to enjoy a marked increase in living standards due to the general slowdown of the post-Brexit economy, a report published by the Resolution Foundation said Tuesday.",2016-08-17,0.0,0.0,0.4697594997594997,0.021538821801979698

This is 450 million meals a day under threat,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.""To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans,"" Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.""You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing,"" said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974. Most of the remaining stocks are fully fished, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.At risk are hundreds of millions of people who depend on fisheries to earn a living, for food and nutrition, according to the FAO.The industry has vessels operating all over the world - some 15,000 European Union-registered fishing boats work off the coast of West Africa for example. Although legal, it is unsustainable, according to Oceana.Fish stocks will quickly bounce back if areas where fish spawn are protected, if fish stocks are managed scientifically, and if destructive and illegal fishing ended, Gustavsson said.""If we do all the right things now, in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally,"" he said.""We could increase the number of meals from 450 million a day today to maybe 1 billion.""An international agreement to curb illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing came into force in June.The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing allows a country to block ships it suspects of illicit fishing, stopping their catches from entering local and international markets.It will be a key driver in the international community's fight against illicit fishing, FAO said.",2016-08-18,0.0,0.0,0.3473165092483274,0.07947904368358914

Now it takes us one year from the word go,"" said Lim Dae-gyu, a director at Cosmax Inc (192820.KS), a cosmetics manufacturer with annual sales of close to $500 million.""For South Korean mass brands, it takes less - just 4-6 months from planning to market launch is average,"" Lim added.strong>WINNING FORMULA</strongSouth Korea last year overtook the United States and Japan to become the No. 2 cosmetics exporter to China after France. It shipped $1.1 billion worth of skincare creams, facial masks, compacts and other cosmetic products to the world's second-largest economy, according to the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety.South Korea's total cosmetics exports were worth $2.59 billion, up 44 percent from 2014, with Hong Kong and the United States its second- and third-biggest markets, a long way behind China.Sales are boosted by South Korea's duty-free market - the world's biggest - which caters especially to big-spending Chinese tourists. Cosmetics accounted for nearly half of the country's record duty-free revenue of 5.8 trillion won ($5.1 billion) in the first half of this year, customs data showed.The trade is not without its downside. To counter unofficial re-sales, Korea's Customs Service is considering setting a 50 product limit for duty-free buyers, a customs official said. Analysts say this could dent sales by smaller firms, but note that bigger companies already limit duty-free purchases to control store inventory.""New ingredients, new packaging, new formulas come on the market continuously, and when something does well Korean brands respond quickly,"" said Jang Jun-kee, managing director of the Korea Cosmetics Foundation, an industry group.Amorepacific's 2008 hit product, the cushion compact - a multifunctional sponge applicator for anything from liquid facial cover and sun protection to make-up base and moisturiser - inspired follow-up products from global brands such as L'Oreal's (OREP.PA) Lancome and Estee Lauder's (EL.N) Clinique.Innovative, often cute, packaging also helps.The Face Shop, a mass brand from South Korea's second-ranked cosmetics firm LG Household &amp; Health Care (051900.KS), said last month it sold out of its initial 130,000 cushion compacts featuring Disney characters - costing 20,000 won ($17.82) - in just two days. It said it expects to launch about 600 new products this year.Beyond popularising beauty trends such as facial cosmetic products ""BB cream"" and ""CC cream"", South Korea has a reputation for innovation and for using natural and Oriental medicine ingredients from flowers and tea leaves to donkey milk, snail and seahorse to differentiate its so-called K-beauty products.""Korean consumers are very sophisticated.

The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",2016-08-11,0.2,0.1,0.38365384615384623,0.06027930402930404

The verdict, dated June 27, was available on the Lausanne court's website.It also awarded Iran 450,000 Swiss francs ($461,302) in court costs and lawyer fees.It remains unclear whether Israel will pay up given restrictions its ""trading with the enemy"" laws.Lawyers for each side had been locked in an arbitration over the Eilat-Ashkelon Pipeline Co (EAPC), a joint venture set up in 1968, when the two nations were friendly, to transport Iranian oil to the Mediterranean.For a decade, the pipeline successfully carried oil from the Red Sea for export to Europe. But since the Islamic revolution that brought the ayatollahs to power, Iran has been demanding its share of revenues and assets that remained in Israel.Since the partnership collapsed, EAPC has grown into a complex of energy assets, now mostly handling oil from former Soviet states.How much profit it has made or how much it is worth is unknown, largely because it is protected in a similar way to Israel's intelligence agencies, including by gag orders restricting coverage of its activities.But Tehran, setting aside its decades-old refusal to recognise Israel's right to exist, had determined to recoup its part of EAPC and pursued a complex arbitration case since 1994, first in France and then in Switzerland.In that time, the company has become the largest distributor of oil in Israel, with ambitions to become a major hub for energy trading in the Mediterranean. Israel maintains tight controls over EAPC.The company has its roots in the 1967 Middle East war, when Egypt blocked the Suez Canal, making it impossible for Iran to transport its oil by tanker to Europe. Under the EAPC deal, Iranian tankers would unload at the Red Sea port of Eilat and oil would flow 254 km (158 miles) northwest to Ashkelon.The countries formed a straw company in Halifax, Canada called APC Holdings, the primary shareholder in EAPC. By December 1969 the pipeline was ready to handle 60 million tons of crude a year, though it never reached that level.A decade later Iran's Shah was ousted and the partners in EAPC became enemies overnight.Lawyers for both countries have declined to comment.Case number: 4A_322/2015 ($1 = 0.9755 Swiss francs)",2016-08-11,0.2,0.1,0.38365384615384623,0.06027930402930404

4054,Sales Tax initiatives check huge tax evasi,"strong>ISLAMABAD: The newly introduced sales tax automation system would help generate additional billions of rupees for the national exchequer besides ensuring transparency discipline and proper monitoring of sales and purchase all across the country.</strongThe Sales Tax Real time Invoice Verification Strive System has been put in place to check leakages in the tax system and improve overall revenue collections, Member Sales Tax Dr. M. Irshad said while talking to APP here.He said that the purpose of the system was to check under invoicing as well as flying invoicing which has been causing damages of billions of rupees to the government in terms of tax evasion.He said that although the system has been put in place since the commencement of the current fiscal year however the actual impact could be evaluated after August 18 when the FBR receives returns from the sales taxpayers.We expect that with the help of this system additional Rs40 to Rs 50 billion per annum revenue could be collected by checking and removing the loopholes and leakages, he added.As per the system all the companies and individuals involved in selling of goods would be bound to submit electronically their invoices of previous month to the FBR by 10th of next month and later file their returns by 18th of that month.This practice would help FBR to recheck and re examines the tax collection when the invoices and actual files are submitted hence it would not only help check the bottlenecks in the tax collection system but would also make the overall system transparent.He said that since the system was in place since July 1 2016 so the sales taxpayers are bound to submit their invoices (annexes) by 10th of August and file their returns by August 18. The board would then make cross check to ensure that no under voicing and flying invoicing has been included for the purpose of tax evasion, he told APP.He was of the view that FBR had been facing such problems for a long time and it was after long consideration that this software has been developed to overcome the problems.He said that before launching the software the FBR had launched a pilot project and approached businessmen and chambers to inform them and create awareness among them regarding the system.The member ST FBR said that similar systems have been developed to check sales tax evasion by vendors and electricity distribution companies (Discos) all across the country.In future two more software are being developed to introduce same facility in the real estate business and motor registration system.He said that the FBR has taken many incentives to revamp the existing sales tax system to facilitate taxpayers and also improve revenue collection system by making it taxpayer friendly transparent and disciplined.Meanwhile the FBR and Auditor General for Pakistan Revenues (AGPR) have joined hands to check tax evasions of billions of rupees by monitoring sale and purchase activities of government vendors.The FBR in collaboration with AGPR has put a mechanism in place to monitor and access complete data of sale and purchase of government vendors through Monitoring and Invoice Verification System in order to check almost 80 percent of the sales tax evasion by the vendors, a senior official of the board told APP.As per the common practice the government vendors were filing only one fifth of the sales tax on Sales Tax Return Number (STRN) with Accountant General Office (AG) on their own while evading 80 percent government tax due to non availability of the STN verification facility at AGP.The purpose is to check the malpractice that has been inflicting huge loss to national exchequer in terms of tax evasion adding that with this system the cross verification of the STRN of all the vendors working with government could be verified.The FBR would also involve District Controller Accounts for properly accessing the data of the government vendors and contractors and ask them for filing of 80 percent sales tax account in order to recover huge amount evaded in terms of the sales tax.",2016-08-12,0.9,0.4000000000000001,0.3634111384111384,0.08431613431613431

This is 450 million meals a day under threat,"" said Lasse Gustavsson, executive director of Oceana in Europe on Wednesday.""To solve the overfishing problem, including illegal fishing, we want to create transparency in the oceans,"" Gustavsson told the Thomson Reuters Foundation from Madrid.Oceana, an international conservation organisation, together with Google and SkyTruth, a nonprofit group that uses aerial and satellite images to track changes in the landscape, are due to launch the Global Fishing Tracker within weeks.The public, non-governmental organisations and local authorities will be able to use it to monitor coastlines and marine conservation areas, follow individual boats in near real-time and track what boats of a particular flag are doing.It will be especially useful for countries like Madagascar which have few resources to patrol and monitor their own coastlines, Oceana said.""You can slice that piece of data in many different ways which we think will be helpful when it comes to law enforcement, increasing public understanding, and catching the kind of people who are doing stuff they shouldn't be doing,"" said Gustavsson.Some 30 percent of fish stocks were overfished in 2013, up from 10 percent in 1974. Most of the remaining stocks are fully fished, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) said.At risk are hundreds of millions of people who depend on fisheries to earn a living, for food and nutrition, according to the FAO.The industry has vessels operating all over the world - some 15,000 European Union-registered fishing boats work off the coast of West Africa for example. Although legal, it is unsustainable, according to Oceana.Fish stocks will quickly bounce back if areas where fish spawn are protected, if fish stocks are managed scientifically, and if destructive and illegal fishing ended, Gustavsson said.""If we do all the right things now, in 10 years we will have twice as much fish in the ocean globally,"" he said.""We could increase the number of meals from 450 million a day today to maybe 1 billion.""An international agreement to curb illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing came into force in June.The Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing allows a country to block ships it suspects of illicit fishing, stopping their catches from entering local and international markets.It will be a key driver in the international community's fight against illicit fishing, FAO said.",2016-08-18,0.0,0.0,0.3473165092483274,0.07947904368358914

4068,Illicit gold Indias smugglers shut out refiners b,"strong>MUMBAI: Indian gold refiners just months ago were ramping up capacity and struggling to secure enough ore from miners. Now, they are suspending operations as a surge in smuggled bullion wipes out wafer thin margins.</strongGold importing banks and big jewelers have also been hit by the growing entry of illicit gold, which avoids import duties and makes its way on to the so-called ""grey market"" where it is sold to end-users at a discount.Smuggled gold could account for more than a third of demand this year in India - the world's second-biggest buyer of the metal after China - potentially costing the government over $1 billion in lost revenue.The upsurge will lead to pressure for a reduction in the 10 percent import duty and a rethink on recently introduced levies on gold jewelry, which critics say are boosting the unofficial trade the government has been trying to curb.""Gold refiners have less than a 1 percent margin. If smugglers offer 4 or 5 percent discounts, then we have no choice but to close our operations,"" James Jose, secretary of the Association of Gold Refineries and Mints told Reuters.All 32 refineries in the country have stopped buying dore - a semi-pure alloy made by miners - in the past few months and are relying on treating scrap gold until market conditions normalize, he said.""Last fiscal year we refined 120 tonnes of gold. With local scrap supplies we can produce 20 tonnes of refined gold in the current year,"" said Rajesh Khosla, managing director of MMTC-PAMP India, the country's biggest refinery.strong>SMUGGLING GROWS</strongIndia raised the duty on gold imports to 10 percent three years ago, aiming to dampen buying and narrow the current account deficit in a country where gold is seen as a store of wealth for rich and poor alike.Smugglers evade the duty and offer cheap gold to buyers such as bullion dealers and small jewelers, who can pay up to $100 an ounce below official domestic prices, currently around $1,340 an ounce.Falling gold prices deterred the illicit trade last year but smuggling has surged in recent months amid rising prices and the reintroduction in March of a 1 percent local sales tax on gold jewelry.Smuggled gold into India could double to as much as 300 tonnes in 2016, said Bachhraj Bamalwa, director at All India Gems and Jewellery Trade Federation, although the World Gold Council (WGC) has put the figure at 160 tonnes. At 300 tonnes, the government would forego about $1.3 billion at current gold prices.The new sales tax has encouraged smaller jewelers in particular to buy on the grey market, said Somasundaram PR, managing director of the WGCs' Indian operations. The jewelry must be sold without receipts, but goes to customers looking to hide funds from the authorities.The finance ministry did not respond to requests for comment on gold smuggling.strong>BANKS HIT</strongThe legal trade is also facing headwinds from a 26 percent rise in the gold price this year which has discouraged overall buying and made smuggled gold available at deep discounts.India's official gold imports fell 57 percent in the first seven months of 2016 to 215 tonnes, and could fall more than 60 percent for the year to 350 tonnes to 400 tonnes, the lowest level in two decades, said Sunil Kashyap, managing director, Global Banking and Markets at Scotiabank.Banks, which until last year were the main source of gold supply, are losing their market share quickly.""Since there were hefty discounts in the grey market, consumers shifted from banks to grey markets,"" Arindam Sarkar, senior vice president at Axis Bank, the biggest bullion importing bank in the country, told Reuters.""So far in 2016 our bullion business is down nearly 75 percent,"" he said.Bigger, more reputable jewelers are also suffering.""Small jewelers buy gold at 4 or 5 percent discount and then sell jewelry at 1 or 2 percent discount,"" said Aditya Pethe, a director at Waman Hari Pethe Jewellers in Mumbai.""The business of big jewelers like us is getting affected.But jewelers buying from the grey market say they have little choice.""I wasn't buying gold from grey market for months, but others were buying and doing business,"" said a Mumbai-based jeweler, who declined to be identified.""In the last two months I've also started buying as I have to survive.

It was dealt further blows in July when a gunman drove a truck into crowds celebrating Bastille Day on July 14 in the Riviera city of Nice. Two weeks later, two men killed a priest in a small town in Normandy. Strikes against a controversial labour reform and floods in June also deterred tourists.Nightly hotel stays were down 8.5 percent in the Paris-Ile de-France region in the first half, with an 11.5 percent decline for foreign tourists and a 4.8 percent drop for French tourists.Japanese visitors were down 46.2 percent in the first half compared with the same period in 2015, while Russians were down 35 percent, Chinese down 19.6 percent, and Americans down 5.7 percent, the Paris region tourist board statement said.France is the most-visited country in the world, with almost 85 million foreigners last year, including 16 million in Paris.Weak activity in France contributed to a fall in first-half operating profit for French group AccorHotels.

Mitsubishi Heavy Industry also said that it had no comment.A senior industry source who was involved in the Australian submarine bidding called the allegation an ""extraordinary"" attempt to deflect attention from DCNS' security shortcomings.""Clearly there's been a massive leak. And for the French to seek to blame either the Japanese or the Germans under some banner of 'economic warfare' is hysterical,"" he told Reuters.The French victory in one of the world's most valuable defence contracts was a major blow to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's push to develop defence export capabilities as part of a more muscular security agenda.Australian Defence Minister Marise Payne visited Tokyo this week to meet with her Japanese counterpart, Tomomi Inada, in the first such visit since the contract was awarded.DCNS and TKMS are currently locked in another competition for a lucrative contract to replace Norway's fleet of aging Ula-class submarines.

U.S. gold futures for December delivery were down $2.80 an ounce at $1,323.10.Gold whipsawed on Friday, rising as much as 1.5 percent in the immediate wake of Yellen's comments, before slipping back to end the day marginally lower.""The market was surprised (by Yellen) -- that is why it went all the way up first, before losing it all,"" Afshin Nabavi, head of trading at MKS in Switzerland, said. ""The demand for physical (gold) is still very poor, so it feels like we may need to test lower levels first before a surge in price.""Gold's volatility tracked fluctuations in the dollar. The U.S. currency gave up gains soon after Yellen spoke as she gave no indication that a rate hike was imminent, but rebounded as traders reassessed her words, and after Fed Vice Chair Fischer said the Fed was still on track to lift rates this year.Gold is highly sensitive to rising U.S. interest rates, which increase the opportunity cost of holding non-yielding bullion while boosting the dollar, in which it is priced.""The pressure on gold will likely increase as we go into September, as participants are now more willing to bet on a rate hike given what they have gleaned from top Fed officials on Friday,"" INTL FCStone said in a note.Hedge funds and money managers increased their net long position in COMEX gold contracts in the week to Aug. 23, U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) data showed on Friday.Silver was little changed at $18.61 an ounce, having earlier touched its lowest in more than eight weeks at $18.36 an ounce.Platinum, the biggest faller among the major precious metals last week, was up 1 percent at $1,077.60 an ounce, while palladium was down 0.2 percent at $684.38 an ounce.",2016-08-29,0.35,0.05,0.4184792626728111,0.0963978494623656

4080,Oil prices rebound on weaker dollar,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices rose in early Asian trade on Thursday, rebounding on a weaker U.S. dollar after falling around 3 percent or more in the previous session following a surprisingly large build in U.S. crude and distillate stocks last week.</strong""The weaker dollar is providing support for oil prices today. The direction of oil prices is governed by supply and the strength of the dollar,"" said Jonathan Barratt, chief investment officer at Sydney's Ayers Alliance.The U.S. dollar index slipped against a basket of currencies on Thursday. A weaker dollar makes greenback-denominated commodities including oil cheaper for holders of other currencies.U.S. crude futures had climbed 12 cents to $44.82 a barrel by 2025 EST, after falling $1.65, or 3.6 percent, in the previous session.Brent crude futures climbed 10 cents to $46.99 a barrel after settling $1.33 lower, or 2.8 percent, at the previous close.That came after U.S. crude inventories rose 2.3 million barrels to 1.221 billion barrels in the week to Aug. 26, data from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration showed on Wednesday. That compared with analyst expectations of a 921,000-barrel increase.Distillate stocks, which include diesel and heating oil, unexpectedly rose by 1.5 million barrels, while gasoline inventories fell by 691,000 barrels, about half the forecast drawdown.""In the absence of any price shocks, oil prices remain rangebound - as soon as oil gets down to the lower end of $40 a barrel prices find support. When oil gets down to $40-$42 investors buy, when it gets to $48-$50 they sell again"", Barratt said.Speculation the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil producers might agree to curb output at talks in Algeria later this month helped fuel an 11-percent rise in crude prices in August, the best monthly return since April.But optimism of an output freeze has since waned.""The market is very complacent on whether OPEC can come up with a supply freeze deal. The market doesn't believe OPEC has the ability to achieve an agreement freezing supply,"" Barratt added.Investors are also waiting for U.S. non-farm payroll data on Friday to give the market direction, ANZ Bank said in a note.",2016-09-01,0.0,0.0,0.4553724053724055,-0.035615079365079357

We'll discuss the details today,"" Bulog procurement director Wahyu said on Friday, referring to discussions with the trade and agriculture ministers.Wahyu, who like many Indonesians goes by one name only, said the deal would bring Indonesia's total buffalo meat imports to 80,000 tonnes in 2016.The buffalo meat imports are intended to help stabilize meat prices that have climbed as a result of beef and cattle import restrictions.""Buffalo meat imports provide a meat alternative to the community that's cheaper, healthy and Halal,"" Bulog CEO Djarot Kusumayakti told reporters.According to trade ministry data, beef currently costs around 115,000 rupiah ($8.68) per kg. Bulog is selling buffalo meat for 65,000 per kg at a consumer level.President Joko Widodo said earlier this year he wants fresh beef to cost around 80,000 rupiah per kg.Indonesia, which has the world's biggest Muslim population, imports virtually all of its cattle from Australia - a trade that was worth nearly $600 million in the last financial year.Indonesia is pushing importers to start breeding their own cattle as part of efforts to reduce its dependence on imports.Last year, Indonesia had to cull millions of chickens to ease supply swings and issued more import permits for cattle to cool beef prices.Bulog will also import 260,000 tonnes of raw sugar this year, ""most of it from Brazil,"" Bulog CEO Djarot Kusumayakti told reporters.In June, Southeast Asia's largest economy said it would control wheat imports that had jumped after corn imports were capped this year.($1 = 13,251 rupiah)",2016-09-02,0.0,0.0,0.4225371120107962,0.19048582995951416
4083,Consumer giants Muslims halal face creams ,"strong>LONDON/JAKARTA: Some of the world's biggest consumer groups are making halal face creams and shampoos for Indonesia ahead of a new labeling law, part of a broader push to cater to growing Muslim populations as sales in many Western markets slow.</strongUnilever, Beiersdorf and L'Oreal are among the multinationals converting their supply chains for the world's biggest Muslim-majority nation.The law, the first of its kind, requires food to be labeled halal or not in 2017, followed by toiletries in 2018 and medicines in 2019.The companies say demand for beauty products that are halal, or target specific issues like veiled hair, will grow as the Muslim middle class grows. They note that Indonesia could influence other countries such as Malaysia where halal products made locally or by small, niche companies are also popular.Halal certification is official recognition that a product was manufactured in keeping with Islamic Sharia law. This means it must not contain traces of pork, alcohol or blood, and must be made on factory lines free of contamination risk, including from cleaning.Makers of cosmetics and toiletries say the burden is more administrative than financial, and therefore see compliance as unlocking new revenue streams.""It's an enabler to do business in certain areas of the world,"" said Dirk Mampe of German chemicals company BASF, which sells ingredients to toiletries manufacturers and now has 145 of them certified halal. The halal ingredients do not carry premium price tags, he said.""There is a trend that these halal products are being requested more and more, and the importance of being able to supply them is increasing.""More than 1.5 billion people around the world are Muslim, accounting for about a quarter of the global population.Halal cosmetics were estimated to make up 11 percent of a global halal market worth more than $1 trillion in 2015, according to Deloitte Tohmatsu Consulting. Market research firm TechNavio sees halal personal care products' sales growing 14 percent per year until 2019, outpacing the broader market.strong>NOT-SO-SECRET FORMULA</strongFrench cosmetics giant L'Oreal already has a halal-certified factory in Indonesia that supplies the domestic market and its Southeast Asian neighbors. Most products under its Garnier brand, from face washes to skin lightening creams, are halal-certified, a spokeswoman said.The personal care industry already depends largely on plant-derived ingredients, so the rules for halal often affect production more than formulation.But certification can get complicated. For example, the maker of an Indonesian skin cream with a dozen ingredients from around the world would need to give Indonesian authorities proof from other certification bodies that each ingredient was made in a halal way.Malaysia-based DagangHalal has made a business from that complexity by establishing an online database of halal certificates to ease their exchange and expedite the process for applicants. As of February, it said 38 out of over 120 certification bodies worldwide had signed up.The company, which also runs a halal e-commerce site, reported 2015 revenue of 5.6 million Malaysian ringgit ($1.4 million), up 64 percent year-on-year. It raised 3.6 million pounds ($4.7 million) from this year's London stock listing, and is betting that halal cosmetics will gain traction beyond their current strongholds of Indonesia and Malaysia.""Halal certification is a requirement that might be put in place by other countries in the future,"" Joerg Karas, general manager of Schwan-Stabilo Cosmetics, said in a statement last month. The German company, which is ready to offer halal-certified products to customers such as L'Oreal and Procter &amp; Gamble, said it is ""well-equipped for this niche market"".Non-halal products will remain available in Indonesia following the labeling law, but may meet a backlash.""The average Muslim consumer in Indonesia is not going to buy something that effectively says prohibited on it,"" said Abdalhamid Evans of halal consultancy firm Imarat Consultants.Unilever, which owns five of Indonesia's top ten beauty and personal care brands, says all nine of its factories there already meet halal standards and that it is currently working with third-party suppliers of imported ingredients.Alan Jope, who runs Unilever's personal care business from Singapore, told Reuters the cost of certification was ""not material"".strong>MUSLIM VALUES</strongCompetition with homegrown rivals steeped in local tradition can be fierce, especially when it comes to regulation. But Jope said the key for multinationals like Unilever -- with global marketing and development teams -- is understanding Muslim values generally and how they influence habits in specific markets with different cultures and ethnicities.""Some (values) are common across Muslim countries,"" he said, noting that about 90 percent of Muslim consumers say faith influences their brand choices.""But there's quite substantial differences between how a Muslim woman in Indonesia and a Muslim woman in Saudi Arabia express their faith and how that impacts their beauty regimes.""He guessed that one third of the top twenty markets for Unilever's 20 billion euros-per-year business were countries with large Muslim populations, from India to Nigeria. He said better meeting their needs was a top strategic priority.To that end, Unilever has introduced products such as a gel body moisturizer that absorbs quickly beneath long undergarments and a long-lasting toothpaste appealing to those fasting for Ramadan.Like rival Henkel, it sells a line of shampoo for veiled hair, but Jope said the industry needs to improve its advertising, such as by featuring more women in hijabs.""We need to be doing a better job reflecting Muslim values in our brand communication,"" he said.($1 = 4.0480 ringgit)($1 = 0.7614 pounds)",2016-09-02,0.0,0.0,0.39263921010496344,0.13799887327284588
4084,India Ambani telecoms venture free calls cut price d,"strong>MUMBAI: Reliance Industries unveiled its Jio telecom network on Thursday, touting free calls and rock-bottom data prices that sent shares of established telecom players into a nosedive on fears of an all-out price war.</strongReliance Chairman Mukesh Ambani, India's richest man, told the energy group's annual shareholders' meeting that services on the Jio network would be available for free until Dec. 31 in a ""welcome offer"".Reliance, which has been giving freebies for the past few months as part of network testing, did not say when it would start billing customers.Reliance, one of India's biggest conglomerates which gets most of its revenue from its sprawling oil and gas business, has in recent years expanded into more consumer-facing markets such as retail and telecoms as growth slows in its core business.The company, which secured telecom airwaves in 2010, has so far invested more than $20 billion on building a nationwide network and has pledged to offer affordable services to price-conscious Indian customers.Ambani, who was interrupted by repeated rounds of applause as he took shareholders in a packed auditorium through Jio's ambitious rollout plans, free countrywide roaming offering and more, vowed to ""transform India from a high-priced data market to one with the lowest data rates anywhere in the world.""Jio could make Reliance a big provider of telecoms and internet services across India - a nation of 1 billion mobile phone subscribers - and is a key plank of Ambani's strategy, even though the business is unlikely to add significantly to group profits any time soon.Jio will effectively price 1 gigabyte of data at about 50 rupees on average, about one-fifth of what rivals charge, Reliance said in a statement.Ambani set a target of 100 million customers for Reliance Jio ""in the shortest possible time"", without specifying.strong>PRICE WAR</strongShares in India's No. 1 wireless carrier Bharti Airtel Ltd dropped 6.3 percent while smaller rival Idea Cellular fell 10.5 percent, on fears that Jio's aggressive rates will trigger a price war. Incumbents have already started lowering data prices ahead of Jio's entry.Bharti Airtel said: ""We welcome Reliance Jios entry to the digital world and wish them the very best,"" but made no comment on the new entrant's price plans. Idea did not comment.Still, one telecom analyst with a foreign brokerage said Jio would face challenges in luring low-spending phone users to its network.Jio's cheapest of 10 plans starts at 149 rupees ($2.22) a month and offers just 0.3 gigabytes of data, while the next monthly plan costs 499 rupees for 4 GB of data. It will also offer a 299 rupee plan with 2 GB of data which has to be used in 21 days.By comparison, the monthly average revenue per user for India's telecoms industry, where many still use basic phones, was 127 rupees in the quarter ended March, according to latest data available with the sector regulator.""It is definitely aggressive and will hurt the incumbents,"" said the analyst who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media.

There is also growing scepticism among traders that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers such as Russia will agree to freeze production at a meeting in Algeria later this month.However, lending credence to a freeze, Saudi Arabia, the world's biggest crude exporter, has appeared to change its stance and is likely to support production stabilization at the meeting.But further clouding the issue, Russian Energy Minister Alexander Novak on Friday played down the potential for talks on a possible output freeze.Additionally, more U.S. supply will return to the market as some producers in the eastern parts of the Gulf of Mexico are restarting operations after Hurricane Hermine is set to make landfall.Manufacturing activities in parts of Asia, which accounts for most of the world's oil demand growth, has also slowed.""Most of Asia depends on exports, and without demand picking up in the west and on the mainland (of China), it's hard to see a sustained rebound in trade,"" HSBC economist Frederick Neumann said in a note.",2016-09-02,0.0,0.0,0.5587813620071684,-0.022759856630824377

The PP has denied it has a problem with corruption, saying the cases are isolated and it is tackling them.The World Bank's 189 governors are expected to vote on Soria's candidature as part of the process of appointing 25 executive directors.The Spanish government examines the suitability of candidates based on their track record in public service as well as on their experience when selecting for international posts, the Economy Ministry said.",2016-09-03,0.0,0.0,0.12823691460055098,-0.010468319559228648

4093,Tax exempt military fuel sold on open market Afghani,"strong>KABUL: Tax-exempt military fuel imported into Afghanistan is being sold on the open market, industry officials and a new anti-corruption report reveal, causing the government huge revenue losses as Kabul struggles to wean itself off foreign aid.</strongAn AFP team witnessed first-hand evidence hinting at how duty-free fuel destined for NATO and local forces is being sold commercially when an Afghan energy official swooped unannounced on a Kabul oil depot last week.Flanked by a gaggle of assistants and bodyguards, the official examined a sheaf of customs documents from visibly nervous fuel tanker drivers, scouring the fine print for any trace of the illicit practice that traders have long claimed is crippling the industry.Among the documents from one driver was a ""maafinama"" -- a tax-exemption certificate for military fuel that cuts costs by around $200 a ton -- showing fuel imported from Turkmenistan in the name of the Afghan interior ministry.Only fuel bound for foreign troops as well as the defence and interior ministries -- responsible for Afghan military and police -- is exempted from custom duty, following a security agreement between the government and NATO.""What is this fuel doing in this market?"" asked the official, standing near huge cylindrical reservoirs in the depot that supplies fuel to commercial traders and fuel stations.""That´s the big question,"" he continued as he snapped pictures of the document and truck, pledging a full investigation.He allowed AFP to accompany him during the inspection but requested that his name be withheld for safety reasonsstrong>- ´Misuse´ -</strongNo commodity is as vital to the reconstruction effort in war-ravaged Afghanistan as fuel -- and none more at risk of being stolen, smuggled or wasted in a country bedevilled by corruption, observers say.Last year, more than one million tons of internationally funded military fuel was imported into Afghanistan, the finance ministry said, with its uncharged customs duty estimated to be around $100 million.""The custom duty exemption mechanism... (for) international forces has led to abuse by fuel traders which allows them to illegally profit,"" said a new report by the Independent Joint Anti-Corruption Monitoring and Evaluation Committee (MEC), which was seen by AFP.The report, due to be released on Tuesday, said 20 commercial companies were issued tax-exemption certificates last year.The process to obtain ""maafinamas"" involves a tightly bureaucratic application system that goes through the US military, NATO and the Afghan finance and foreign ministries -- but the document remains prone to ""misuse"".""Companies that possess legitimate exemption forms have been known to sell the original to other companies,"" the report said, explaining how military fuel was ending up in the commercial market.""(Also) after the customs department process the exemption paperwork, the companies that have been granted exemption forms re-sell the fuel.""NATO said it could not immediately comment, and the interior and defence ministries did not respond to AFP´s queries.Shafiq Qarizada, deputy minister for customs, told AFP he ""cannot confirm nor deny"" whether exempted fuel is washing up in the commercial market.strong>- ´Contaminated´ -</strongThe comments come ahead of a crucial conference in Brussels in October, where donor countries are expected to reaffirm civilian aid funding for Afghanistan over the next four years.Afghanistan is battling what observers label ""donor fatigue"" as efforts to replace its huge foreign aid dependency with self-sufficiency are thwarted by corruption and criminal networks imperilling the already weak economy.Misuse of fuel exemptions is killing local businesses in a country that is heavily dependent upon imports to meet its energy needs, two private traders told AFP.The exemption waves off 12 percent customs duty among other charges, officials say.""Maafinamas have contaminated the commercial market,"" said the official who carried out the inspection.""How can a trader who dutifully pays taxes compete with cheaper maafinama fuel? This is suffocating lawful businesses and encouraging smuggling of fuel... and resulting in custom revenue losses worth millions.""The misuse also has potential military implications.In May last year 17 Afghan policemen were killed when the Taliban stormed their remote base in the mountainous province of Badakhshan.Officials at the time said the policemen were unable to escape because they lacked adequate fuel for their vehicles, raising concern that military fuel was not reaching its intended destination.There are ongoing discussions for a Memorandum of Understanding between NATO and the finance ministry to curb the misuse of maafinamas, multiple sources including Qarizada told AFP.Among various reforms being discussed is a suggestion to levy customs duty on all military fuel and reimburse payments for actual deliveries.""MEC understands from interviews with both (NATO) and (finance ministry) that this reform is strongly supported but it is still not implemented,"" the MEC report said.""Why not? Is the reason for the delay perhaps another instance of corruption?""",2016-09-05,0.3,-0.05,0.298735312306741,-0.011393011750154607
4094,Chinas Xi at G20 says world economy at ri,"strong>HANGZHOU, CHINA: The global economy is being threatened by rising protectionism and risks from highly leveraged financial markets, Chinese President Xi Jinping said at the open of a two-day summit of leaders from G20 nations.</strongHis warning on Sunday followed bilateral talks with Barack Obama that the U.S. president described as ""extremely productive"", but which failed to bring both sides closer on thornier topics such as tensions in the South China Sea.With the summit taking place after Britain's vote in June to exit the European Union and before the U.S. presidential election in November, observers expect G20 leaders to mount a defense of free trade and globalization and warn against isolationism.The global economy has arrived ""at a crucial juncture"", Xi said, in the face of sluggish demand, volatile financial markets and feeble trade and investment.""Growth drivers from the previous round of technological progress are gradually fading, while a new round of technological and industrial revolution has yet to gain momentum,"" he said.G20 countries are set to agree in a communique at the end of the summit that all policy measures - including monetary, fiscal and structural reforms - should be used to achieve solid and sustainable economic growth, Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Koichi Hagiuda said.""Commitment will be made to utilizing all three policy tools of monetary and fiscal policies and structural reforms to achieve solid, sustainable, balanced and inclusive growth,"" Hagiuda told reporters on the sidelines of the summit.Xi also called on G20 countries to match their words with actions.""We should turn the G20 group into an action team, instead of a talk shop,"" he said.But some of the G20 leaders have begun drawing battle lines in disputes over issues ranging from trade and investment to tax policy and industrial overcapacity.BATTLE LINESOn Sunday, Xi held talks with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and told him he hoped Australia would continue to provide a fair, transparent and predictable policy environment for foreign investors.China was angered when Australia blocked the A$10 billion ($7.7 billion) sale of the country's biggest energy grid to Chinese bidders last month.China has accused Australia of bowing to protectionist sentiment in blocking the bid for Ausgrid, as well as an earlier one by a China-led consortium to buy cattle company Kidman &amp; Co.Beijing has also criticized Australia, a staunch U.S. ally, for running surveillance flights over disputed islands in the South China Sea.Meanwhile, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said China must set up a mechanism to address its problem of industrial overcapacity, saying it was ""unacceptable"" the European steel industry had lost so many jobs in recent years.""Overcapacity is a global problem but there is a particular Chinese element,"" he told a news conference.Britain's future after its departure from the European Union was also subject to discussion.Obama reassured Prime Minister May that Britain's closest political, commercial and military ally would stand by her.But he did not shrink away from his stance that Brexit was a mistake and that London would not be able to jump the queue to arrange a bilateral trade deal.Juncker said that if Britain wanted access to the European Union's common market, it needed to respect the rules of the common market.Turnbull, meanwhile, said Australia wanted an early free trade agreement with Britain so markets could remain open between them when Britain formally left the European trading bloc.LATE NIGHT TALKSObama held talks with Xi on Saturday that ran late into the night.He urged Beijing to uphold its legal obligations in the disputed waters of the South China Sea, and stressed U.S. commitments to its regional allies.Xi said China would continue to safeguard its sovereignty and maritime rights in the South China Sea.But China is keen to keep the summit focused on economic issues and to prevent other disputes from overshadowing it.According to a ""fact sheet"" on China-U.S. relations issued on Sunday, the two sides agreed on a range of issues, including avoiding competitive currency devaluations and not limiting deal opportunities for foreign information and communication technology providers.Obama, now in the last five months of his presidency, is using the visit to put a final stamp on his signature policy shift toward the Pacific, setting the tone for his White House successor, who will be elected in November and take office on Jan. 20.His visit began chaotically at the Hangzhou airport, where his staff argued with Chinese security over media access. Obama said on Sunday he ""wouldn't over-crank the significance"" of the airport events.""None of this detracts from the broader scope of the relationship (with China),"" he told a news conference. ""The bilateral discussions that we had yesterday were extremely productive and continue to point to big areas of cooperation.""Security was extremely tight in Hangzhou, with parts of the city of 9 million people turned into a virtual ghost town as China seeks to ensure that the G20 summit stays incident-free.",2016-09-05,0.0,0.0,0.2987988677988678,-0.01113653013653014

The dollar, which had slumped 1.38 percent on the yen on Tuesday, shed another 0.5 percent to 101.48 yen.The yen gained additional support from a media report that the Bank of Japan's board is struggling to agree on a common front in its planned policy review.The euro maintained Tuesday's 0.96 percent rise against the dollar, the biggest daily gain in three months on Tuesday and last stood at $1.1247.A resurgent British pound rose to near eight-week high of $1.3445 on Tuesday and held firm at $1.3416.Gold rallied to $1,352.4 per ounce to near three-week highs on Tuesday, and last stood at $1,350.0.The Australian dollar took a breather. It was last down 0.2 percent at $0.7668 after GDP data largely met expectations, with Australia's annual growth clocking its fastest pace in four years last quarter, clinching a remarkable run of 25 years without recession.Oil prices kept some distance from three-week lows touched last week, maintaining a part of gains made after Saudi Arabia and Russia agreed on Monday to cooperate in world oil markets, saying they will not act immediately but could limit output in the future.Brent crude futures stood at $47.49 per barrel LCOc1, up 0.5 percent on the day and above its low last week of $45.32.",2016-09-07,0.0,0.0,0.33682870370370366,0.03025958994708994

4105,Oil prices fall US drillers add rigs speculators cut long positi,"strong>SINGAPORE: Crude prices fell over 1.5 percent on Monday after U.S. oil drillers added rigs to look for new production as producers adapt to cheaper crude, with speculators cutting positions betting on further price rises.</strongBrent crude futures were trading at $47.29 per barrel at 0200 GMT, down 72 cents, or 1.5 percent, from their last settlement.U.S. West Texas Intermediate futures were down 80 cents, or 1.74 percent, at $45.08 a barrel.Traders said the price falls on Monday and Friday were a result of increasing oil drilling activity in the United States, which indicated that producers can operate profitably around current levels.""Each dollar is being used far more efficiently and, as a result, $50 oil appears much more palatable,"" Barclays bank said in a note to clients.U.S. drillers added oil rigs for a tenth week in the past 11, according to a Baker Hughes rig count report on Friday. It was the longest streak without rig cuts since 2011.Speculative oil traders also became less confident of higher oil prices, cutting their net long U.S. crude futures and options positions for a second consecutive week last week, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Friday.Oil's near 5-percent price decline since Sept. 8 partly reverses a 10-percent rally early in the month, which was fuelled by speculation that oil exporters could cap production.Algeria's energy minister said there is a consensus among OPEC and non-OPEC members about the need to stabilise the oil market to support prices, state news agency APS reported on Saturday.OPEC Secretary-General Mohammed Barkindo told APS that OPEC was not seeking a definite price range for oil but rather ""sustainable stability"" for the market.Moves towards clinching a global deal on stabilising crude output come five months after similar talks for a production freeze failed when Saudi Arabia insisted that Iran join the pact.Tehran says it supports any measures to stabilise the market, but has stopped short of committing to output restraint before its production reaches 4 million barrels per day, the level at which it says it was pumping before the imposition of Western sanctions which were lifted last January.Even if exporters agree on freezing output around current levels, analysts said that would do little to raise prices as most exporters are pumping out oil at or near record levels, and have adapted to do so at lower prices.""Producers and service companies ... are well positioned to return to growth mode at much lower prices,"" Barclays said.",2016-09-12,0.4,-0.05,0.45216640085061144,-0.08365563530037211

""Weaker oil prices are likely to weigh on the sector, with investor appetite remaining weak.""Gains in crude prices could also be capped by rising crude exports from Libya after the country's National Oil Corporation (NOC) said on Tuesday it would immediately start working to resume crude exports from ports seized in recent days by forces loyal to eastern commander Khalifa Haftar.Libyan production could be raised to 600,000 barrels per day (bpd) from about 290,000 bpd within a month, further adding to the global crude supply glut.",2016-09-14,0.6333333333333333,-0.26666666666666666,0.4941358024691358,-0.2046296296296297

They thought because cost was high, prices will remain high ... (but) then there was the advent of shale. Since that period, there is a realization that there is no scarcity of oil.""The shale revolution turned the United States into one of the world's biggest oil producers, at a time when exporters in the Middle East and Russia were also pumping out record volumes, causing oil prices LCOc1 to more than halve since mid-2014 to under $50 per barrel.The FPSO Opportunity, which has been laid up for over two years, was built in 1972 and operated by Chevron CV.N and Australia's Woodside Petroleum (WPL.AX) before being taken over by a Bermuda-registered FPSO Opportunity Inc in 2011. The newest owner could not be reached for comment.NEW LANDSCAPEThe growing number of vessels anchored in the Johor river estuary is changing the landscape for the locals.""I've been coming here to fish every day for 10 years, and never have there been more ships parked,"" said an angler named Aiman, sitting on an unused pipeline lying on the beach.""It is quite intimidating to come here before dawn and to find, with the first rays of sun, another big ship has been parked here,"" he added, with his line dangling in the river.And it's not just Malaysia that has become the dumping ground for idled oil equipment.Across the Singapore Strait, in the bays of Indonesia's Batam island, over a hundred oil drilling and support vessels have been sitting idle for months, or even years.While laying up ships is legal and even provides profit to specialist mothballing companies, environmental groups say the growing number adds to the risk to flora and fauna.""The idling oil tankers risk polluting the marine environment, which a sizable population of the riverine fishermen rely on for their living,"" said Vincent Chow, chairman of the Malaysian Nature Society in Johor, citing the threat of dissolving paint and potential leakage of heavy metals and fuel into the sea.strong>COST OF DOING NOTHING</strongThe armada of laid-up vessels shows how the shale boom caught the oil industry off guard and scuppered plans to drill for new fields.Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie said global exploration spending halved in 2015, while BMI Research sees capital expenditure among oil producers suffering another sharp decline this year.Struggling drilling companies are paying to lay up rigs in the hope they will survive until demand picks up again.The cost depends on size and location, and whether they are in a so-called ""hot lay-up"", whereby equipment is kept operational so the vessel quickly returns to service, or ""cold lay-up"" whereby ships can be mothballed for years.Cold lay-up for a rig or large oil tanker costs $20,000 to $25,000 a month in Johor, said Balasubramanian Krishna, operations manager at Malaysian lay-up specialist Ocean Shipcare, while laying-up a small supply vessel costs $3,000 to $4,000 a month.Matti Bargfried, head of marketing at maritime software company CODie, said a lay-up time of several years could make re-commissioning lengthy and costly.""The main concern here is preservation against humidity, leakage of chemicals and condition of the hull,"" he said.This means that some of the idled vessels may have to be scrapped in yards in countries such as India or Bangladesh, although shippers say the current cost of the journey may be more than their scrap value.",2016-09-22,0.45,-0.25,0.41616598313966735,0.04396445659603555

4121,India speed up hydropower building rivers flowing Paki,"strong>NEW DELHI: India will accelerate its building of new hydropower plants along three rivers that flow into Pakistan, a source familiar with the plan said on Monday, in a move likely to aggravate already tense relations with its neighbour a week after an attack on an Indian army base.</strongDisagreements over how to share the waters of the Indus and other rivers have dogged relations between the nuclear-armed arch-rivals since independence in 1947.The dispute looks set to be reignited after Prime Minister Narendra Modi told officials on Monday that India should use more of the rivers' resources, speaking a week after the Sept. 18 attack on an army base in the disputed region of Kashmir that New Delhi blames on Pakistan, a source with knowledge of the meeting attended by Modi said.India has vowed to respond to the raid, in which at least 18 of its soldiers were killed, but any military option risks escalation. Some officials have called for a renewed diplomatic offensive instead.Modi said on Saturday that India would mount a global campaign to isolate Pakistan, including through the United Nations, where Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj spoke on Monday.India has long accused Pakistan of backing militant groups operating in the Himalayan state of Jammu and Kashmir, through which several of the countries' shared rivers flow.Pakistan denies the allegations and says India has not provided adequate proof to support its claims. A spokesman for Pakistan's foreign office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about Modi's hydropower plans.At Monday's meeting, Modi and officials discussed ways to increase exploitation of the Chenab, Jhelum and Indus rivers but said they would not violate a long-standing water treaty between the countries in the process.""We want to see that all these (hydropower) projects are put on a really fast-track basis,"" the source told Reuters, speaking on the condition he was not named because of the sensitivity of the meeting.""Our entire approach was done to create an atmosphere of goodwill. But in this atmosphere, we want to exploit all our rights under the (Indus Water) treaty,"" the source said.The Indus Water Treaty was signed in 1960 in a bid to resolve disputes, but India's ambitious irrigation plans and construction of thousands of upstream dams has continued to annoy Pakistan, which depends on snow-fed Himalayan rivers for everything from drinking water to agriculture.India says its use of upstream water is strictly in line with the 1960 agreement.The potential for a military conflict between India and Pakistan over water has long worried observers.The neighbours have fought two of their three wars over Kashmir.India currently generates about 3,000 megawatts of energy from hydropower plants along rivers in its portion of Kashmir, but believes the region has the potential to produce 18,000 megawatts, the source said.New Delhi will also review whether to restart construction of the Tulbul navigation project, which was suspended several years ago. The project proposes diverting water from one of the shared rivers to a city in Indian-administered Kashmir that could impact flows downstream, the source said. A spokesman for Modi's office declined to comment.",2016-09-27,0.0,0.0,0.41317016317016325,-0.014510489510489518

4124,Turkey suffers 38 visitor drop coup hits touri,"strong>ANKARA: The number of foreigners visiting Turkey plummeted nearly 38 percent in August, with tourism battered by the July failed coup and security concerns after attacks, statistics showed Thursday.</strongThe figures are the first to show visitor numbers for a full month after the attempted putsch which saw a rogue military faction try to oust President Recep Tayyip Erdogan from power and attempt to seize Istanbul´s main international airport.Some 3.18 million visitors came to Turkey in August this year, down 37.96 percent on August 2015, the tourism ministry said in its latest release.June saw the sharpest drop of 40.86 percent compared with the previous year, while in July, the number of arrivals fell by 36.72 percent.The tourism industry had already been hit before the coup by a string of attacks this year including the triple suicide bombing at Istanbul´s main airport in June which left 47 dead and was blamed on the Islamic State group.Last month, 57 people including 34 children were killed in a suicide bombing during a Kurdish wedding in the southern city of Gaziantep. IS was again blamed by Turkish authorities.The tourism industry last year was worth $35.1 billion in revenues and it accounts for 4.4 percent of GDP in Turkey.Despite normalising ties with Moscow in June and the lifting of travel sanctions this summer, visitor numbers to Turkey from Russia fell 83.63 percent last month compared with the previous year.In August 2015, the overall number of Russian visitors was nearly 640,000 but this year´s figure for August was under 105,000, in a devastating blow to tourism on Turkey´s Mediterranean coast.However, the resumption of charter flights to Turkish resorts at the start of September could see a welcome rise in Russian visitors.Arrivals in August from the key tourism market of Germany were down 34.5 percent while arrivals from Iran -- an increasing source of tourism -- fell almost 32 percent.Saudi Arabia was the only key tourism market to see any growth with visitor numbers from the kingdom reversing the trend and doubling in August 2015.In its latest trading update Tuesday, British travel operator Thomas Cook Group said that there was strong demand for most destinations except Turkey.The operator saw a four percent slump in bookings because of Turkey where ""demand continues to be volatile"", Peter Fankhauser, the group´s chief executive, said in a statement.",2016-09-29,0.7,-0.6,0.37053872053872056,0.04612794612794613

4128,OPEC agrees modest oil output curbs first deal since 2008,"strong>ALGIERS: OPEC agreed on Wednesday modest oil output cuts in the first such deal since 2008, with the group's leader Saudi Arabia softening its stance on arch-rival Iran amid mounting pressure from low oil prices.</strong""OPEC made an exceptional decision today ... After two and a half years, OPEC reached consensus to manage the market,"" said Iranian Oil Minister Bijan Zanganeh, who had repeatedly clashed with Saudi Arabia during previous meetings.He and other ministers said the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries would reduce output to a range of 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day. OPEC estimates its current output at 33.24 million bpd.""We have decided to decrease the production around 700,000 bpd,"" Zanganeh said.The move would effectively re-establish OPEC production ceilings abandoned a year ago.However, how much each country will produce is to be decided at the next formal OPEC meeting in November, when an invitation to join cuts could also be extended to non-OPEC countries such as Russia.Oil prices LCOc1 jumped more than 5 percent to trade above $48 per barrel as of 2015 GMT. Many traders said they were impressed OPEC had managed to reach a compromise after years of wrangling but others said they wanted to see the details.""This is the first OPEC deal in eight years! The cartel proved that it still matters even in the age of shale! This is the end of the production war' and OPEC claims victory,"" said Phil Flynn, senior energy analyst at Price Futures Group.Jeff Quigley, director of energy markets at Houston-based Stratas Advisors, said the market had yet to discover who would produce what: ""I want to hear from the mouth of the Iranian oil minister that hes not going to go back to pre-sanction levels. For the Saudis, it just goes against the conventional wisdom of what theyve been saying."".Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said on Tuesday that Iran, Nigeria and Libya would be allowed to produce ""at maximum levels that make sense"" as part of any output limits.That represents a strategy shift for Riyadh, which had said it would reduce output to ease a global glut only if every other OPEC and non-OPEC producer followed suit. Iran has argued it should be exempt from such limits as its production recovers after the lifting of EU sanctions earlier this year.The Saudi and Iranian economies depend heavily on oil but in a post-sanctions environment, Iran is suffering less pressure from the halving in crude prices since 2014 and its economy could expand by almost 4 percent this year, according to the International Monetary Fund.Riyadh, on the other hand, faces a second year of budget deficits after a record gap of $98 billion last year, a stagnating economy and is being forced to cut the salaries of government employees.strong>OIL PRICE PRESSURES</strongSaudi Arabia is by far the largest OPEC producer with output of more than 10.7 million bpd, on par with Russia and the United States. Together, the three largest global producers extract a third of the world's oil.Iran's production has been stagnant at 3.6 million bpd in the past three months, close to pre-sanctions levels although Tehran says it wants to ramp up output to more than 4 million bpd when foreign investments in its fields kick in.Saudi oil revenue has halved over the past two years, forcing Riyadh to liquidate billions of dollars of overseas assets every month to pay bills and cut domestic fuel and utility subsidies last year.""The Iranians have lived with a very tough macro backdrop for many years..."" said Raza Agha, chief Middle East economist at investment bank VTB Capital. ""So a sustained drop in oil prices has a more difficult social impact on Saudi.""However, with unemployment in double digits, Tehran is also facing calls to maximize oil revenues and President Hassan Rouhani is under pressure from conservative opponents to deliver a faster economic recovery.Oil prices are well below the budget requirements of most OPEC nations. But attempts to reach an output deal have also been complicated by political rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which are fighting several proxy-wars in the Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen.OPEC sources have said Saudi Arabia offered to reduce its output from summer peaks of 10.7 million bpd to around 10.2 million if Iran agreed to freeze production at around current levels of 3.6-3.7 million bpd.Riyadh has raised production in recent years to compete for market share while Iran's output was limited by sanctions. Minister Zanganeh has said Iran wanted an output cap of close to 4 million bpd. Saudi output drops in winter when it needs less fuel than during summer, when cooling requirements spike.",2016-09-29,0.6166666666666667,0.175,0.35464480874316934,0.043510115794951856

4131,Oil prices surge after OPECs surprise output cut d,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices surged Thursday after the OPEC producers´ group surprised the market with a deal to slash output.</strongAt the end of six hours of negotiations and weeks of horse trading, OPEC announced the plan to cut production to a level of 32.5-33 million barrels per day (bpd) from 33.47 billion, bpd in August, the International Energy Agency (IEA) said.The informal meeting was held on the sidelines of an IEA meeting in a bid to stabilise prices that have been battered by a stubborn supply glut since 2014.Oil prices soared by as much as six percent following the news and extended gains in Asian trade on Thursday although at a slower pace.At around 0100 GMT, US benchmark West Texas Intermediate (WTI) for delivery in November was up 23 cents to $47.29 and Brent crude for November added 22 cents to $48.91 a barrel.The decision to cut output caught the market offguard.Market watchers had been pessimistic about a cut or a freeze after similar efforts fell apart in April due to disagreements between OPEC majors Saudi Arabia and Iran.Angus Nicholson, a Melbourne-based analyst with IG Markets said the OPEC decision was the main impetus for the price surge but said details of the deal ""sound a bit fuzzy at the moment"".""There is the possibility that OPEC managed to commit to a weak deal at this meeting that may pave the way for a more comprehensive production cut at the November meeting,"" he said in a note, referring to OPEC´s formal meeting on November 30.""A more comprehensive deal from OPEC and Russia at the November meeting would easily clear the way for WTI oil to trade around US$55.""Nicholson also said official data showing a fall in the weekly US commercial crude inventories helped to boost the market.The US Energy Information Administration said Wednesday that crude stocks in the world´s top oil consumer fell by 1.9 million barrels, confounding expectations for a rise of three million barrels.A decline in crude stocks signals stronger consumption and is positive for oil prices.""This has now been four straight weeks of back-to-back declines in crude oil inventories, which is also very supportive of the spot price,"" Nicholson said.",2016-09-29,0.0,0.0,0.5287878787878788,-0.01982872200263503

4141,Oil hits highest since June on possible US inventory dr,"strong>LONDON: Oil prices rose towards $52 a barrel on Wednesday, hitting their highest level since June, supported by an industry report that U.S. inventories probably fell for a fifth straight week and OPEC's supply cut deal.</strongThe American Petroleum Institute (API) said on Tuesday that U.S. crude inventories dropped 7.6 million barrels, which would be the fifth straight weekly decline if confirmed by U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data on Wednesday.Brent crude was trading at $51.70 a barrel, up 83 cents, at 0819 GMT. The global benchmark touched $51.72 during the session, its highest since June 10. U.S. crude was up 75 cents at $49.44.Analysts are expecting a rise in crude stocks of 2.6 million barrels.But another drop in U.S. crude stocks would reinforce the view that the supply glut that has been weighing on prices since 2014 is easing. The API data, however, does not always tally with the EIA data, which is due at 1430 GMT.""All eyes now turn to the EIA crude inventory numbers,"" said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, adding that another confirmed drawdown in crude stocks would likely push U.S. crude prices above $50.Brent has risen from below $49 on Sept. 28, when the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries agreed a surprise cut in its output to support prices which are less than half the level of mid-2014.Under the deal, OPEC will target production of between 32.50 million barrels per day (bpd) and 33.0 million bpd, implying a cut of as much as 740,000 bpd from the August level, as reported in OPEC's monthly report.The move marked an about-face by OPEC, which in November 2014 dropped its role of cutting production. Although it hasn't yet worked out all the details, and analysts are skeptical the cut will be implemented, the deal is supporting the market.""The mere threat of a production cut should put a floor under oil prices until the next OPEC meeting on Nov. 30,"" said Jason Gammel of U.S. investment bank Jefferies.",2016-10-05,1.0,0.0,0.607716049382716,-0.19660493827160494
4142,Oil prices ease June highs weaker physical mar,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil futures dipped on Thursday after Saudi Arabia trimmed the price of its flagship crude to Asia, but were still near more than three-month highs following a drop in U.S. crude inventories.</strongU.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were trading at $49.55 per barrel at 0544 GMT, down 28 cents or 0.6 percent from their last settlement.International Brent futures were down 28 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $51.58 per barrel.Both contracts hit their highest levels since June on Wednesday after the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) said crude stockpiles fell 3 million barrels last week to 499.74 million barrels. Despite the drawdowns, stocks were still close to all-time highs.Traders pointed to profit taking following recent price rises and said Thursday's fall also reflected weaker physical crude after top exporter Saudi Arabia cut the price of its Arab Light crude to Asian customers for November in a sign that the global fuel supply overhang persists.Another potential cap on prices comes from the United States.Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at brokerage OANDA in Singapore, said that at around $50 a barrel for WTI, U.S. shale drillers, who have spent much of the year cutting back unprofitable production amid low prices, may start bringing back mothballed rigs.Overall, however, most analysts said that the market was well supported at current levels, especially because of a planned output cut by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).There were also risks of forced supply disruptions, especially in North Africa, Nigeria, and Venezuela.""Oil prices seem headed for higher levels in the coming period,"" Global Risk Management said in its quarterly report this week, pointing to the risk of ""several oil producing countries struggling to increase or even keep production at current levels due to unrest/oil facility wreckages and lack of industry investments"".Barring such a disuption, most analysts did not expect prices to shoot up much further as production will remain high even with an OPEC cut, and plenty of fuel remains in stock.""Resilient production in the U.S. and Russia will postpone crude market rebalancing and keep the market in surplus into 2017,"" BMI Research said in a note to clients, even cutting its price forecast for next year.""With an insufficient demand response to counteract strong supply, the result is a downward revision of our 2017 Brent forecast to $55 per barrel from $57 per barrel,"" BMI said.",2016-10-06,0.14285714285714285,0.0,0.4656067019400352,-0.07539506172839507

4145,Indian cotton exports Pakistan slump tensions trader,"strong>MUMBAI/KARACHI: Rising hostilities between India and Pakistan have brought their $822 million-a-year trade in cotton to a juddering halt, as traders who are worried about uncertainty over supplies and driven by patriotism hold off signing new deals.</strongThe nuclear-armed rivals have seen tensions ratchet up in the past few months over the disputed territory of Kashmir, and cotton traders in both countries said they were watching developments along the de facto border with alarm.Pakistan, the world's third-largest cotton consumer, usually starts importing from September, but three Indian exporters said the number of inquiries had slowed to a trickle in the last two weeks.In the clearest sign yet of souring relations affecting commerce, Pakistan-based importers also said they were not buying.""At the moment there is no cotton trade. It's at standstill. There is uncertainty that, God forbid, if war breaks out, what will happen?"" said Ihsanul Haq, chairman of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.Pakistan Cotton Commissioner Khalid Abdullah said a ""low quantum of trade activity is still taking place.""He said the Pakistan government had not directed traders to stop buying Indian cotton and expected trade to normalize when tensions eased.Indian government officials said they had not yet noticed trading had stopped.But some Indian officials said last week that Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government was considering whether it should choke trade with Pakistan to put pressure on its neighbour, even though the trade balance is in India's favour.strong>INDIA'S BIGGEST COTTON BUYER</strongTrade between India and Pakistan, which have fought three wars since their independence from British rule in 1947, is small.In the 2015/16 fiscal year ending on March 31, official trade between the two was $2.6 billion. Cotton is the largest component of that total.It is not clear whether other goods and commodities traded between the two, such as jewellery and dry fruits, have been hit by the escalation in hostilities as well, but the disruption to cotton shipments is potentially significant.In the crop year ended Sept. 30, Pakistan was India's biggest cotton buyer after its own crop was hit by drought and whitefly pest.It imported 2.5 million bales from India, and supported Indian cotton prices at a time when China was cutting imports, traders said.Lower purchases by Pakistan this year could hurt exports from the world's biggest producer of the fibre and put pressure on Indian prices, but could also help rival cotton suppliers like Brazil, the United States and some African countries.Chirag Patel, chief executive officer of Indian exporter Jaydeep Cotton Fibers, said the country could export 5 million bales in the 2016/17 crop year, but exports could plunge to 3 million bales without Pakistani imports.An exporter based in Mumbai estimated that Pakistan will need to import at least 3 million bales in 2016/17, and India will have a surplus of around 8 million bales.""As soon as the (political) situation improves, cotton trade will definitely resume between the two countries,"" said Haq of the Pakistan Cotton Dealers Association.But for now, traders on both sides of the border said the environment was not conducive to doing business.""Many cotton exporters are not interested in selling cotton to Pakistan. They are trying to find other markets,"" said Pradeep Jain, a ginner based in Jalgaon in the western state of Maharashtra.Shahzad Ali Khan, chairman of Pakistan Cotton Ginners Association, referred to a move by the Indian Motion Picture Producers' Association (IMPPA), a small filmmakers' body, last week, banning their members from hiring Pakistani actors.""India is banning Pakistani artists, so how can it expect us to buy cotton from India?"" Khan said.""In various forums Pakistani traders are saying they will not buy cotton from India this year. Even if they need to pay extra, they will pay and buy it from other suppliers.""",2016-10-08,0.0,0.0,0.3607889237199582,-0.04587251828631139

He will later hold talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.The energy minister of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia, whose assent allowed the output cut to go ahead, meanwhile expressed cautious optimism the price of crude could rise to $60 dollars a barrel by the end of the year.",2016-10-10,0.5,0.2,0.5029540300968873,-0.04567202638631209

The production reference (month) could require Rosneft to curb its current drilling programme, which is contrary to the interests of its private shareholders,"" he said.Oil has rallied more than 13 percent in less than two weeks since the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries proposed its first production curbs in eight years. But prices remain at about half of mid-2014 highs above $100 a barrel as questions remain over when the market will return to balance.Goldman Sachs added its doubts on Tuesday, saying in a research note that the planned oil output cut by OPEC and other exporters has become a ""greater possibility,"" but warned a production cut likely won't be deep enough to re-balance markets in 2017, and that oil prices may fall back into the low $40s per barrel.",2016-10-12,0.0,0.0,0.4648214285714286,-0.008571428571428555

4154,Modi Putin set sign energy deals ahead BRICS,"strong>BENAULIM, India: Russian President Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi are set to seal energy and defence deals Saturday that officials say are signs of a deepening partnership between the nations.</strongPutin will hold talks with Modi after arriving in the Indian tourism state of Goa for a BRICS summit also involving the heads of leading emerging nations Brazil, China and South Africa.Among the agreements expected to be signed between the two leaders are Moscow´s delivery of its most advanced anti-aircraft defence system to India.India, the world´s top defence importer, is undergoing a $100-billion upgrade of its Soviet-era military hardware, as it looks to protect its borders from arch-rival Pakistan and an increasingly assertive China.Modi and Putin will also focus on strengthening energy ties to meet India´s growing thirst for fuel and electricity for its fast-growing economy.Russia´s biggest oil company Rosneft is expected to acquire India´s Essar Oil in a multi-billion-dollar deal, according to local media reports, quoting officials involved in the agreement.""The menu is vast,"" India´s ambassador to Russia, Pankaj Saran said at a briefing on the talks, without detailing the deals to be signed.""It is more than a relationship, it is a partnership and very justifiably it has been described by the two leaders as both special and privileged, as well as of course strategic,"" he said.""It is very deep and very intense and it is poised to grow even further.""Saran said he also expected them to discuss India´s tensions with neighbour Pakistan, which spiked after last month´s attack on an Indian army base that killed 19 soldiers.Modi has sought to isolate Pakistan internationally since the attack that India blamed on Pakistan-based militants.India said it subsequently carried out strikes against militants over the border in Pakistan, prompting a furious response from Islamabad.""We have conveyed our views to the Russian side. We are confident that Russia will reflect upon our concerns,"" Saran said.But Putin is seen as unlikely to weigh into the dispute between the rivals, as Moscow also eyes closer defence ties with Islamabad.

But in recent years Delhi has turned to the United States for supplies, as the two nations forge stronger ties.Modi will also hold bilateral meetings with other BRICS leaders including China´s President Xi Jinping late Saturday, before hosting a dinner in their honour to officially start the BRICS summit.The BRICS leaders will get down to talks on Sunday, with enhancing trade ties along with ""regional and global terrorism"" issues that are expected to be on the agenda.BRICS was formed in 2011 with the aim of using its growing economic and political influence to challenge Western hegemony.",2016-10-15,0.0,0.0,0.3421663059163059,0.02157016594516594

However, those plans were abandoned earlier this year after crippling strikes by staff protesting against privatisation, and a new turnaround strategy drawn up.The government now plans to convert PIA into a limited company and list a 49 percent stake on the local stock exchange, meaning it will retain control of the business for at least two years.After that period, the government could still end up selling its controlling stake.In its ad seeking places to lease, titled ""Revival of PIA"", the company said it was seeking a short-term ""wet lease"" of up to four wide-body aircraft, meaning the planes would come complete with crew and maintenance staff.The ad sought a long-term ""dry lease"" of up to four aircraft, meaning aircraft without crew.It said the lease term would be six to eight years.PIA said the new aircraft must have the latest in in-flight entertainment services.Outdated planes with poor entertainment facilities are among frequent complaints made by travelers about PIA.The privatisation of 68 state-owned companies, including PIA, was a major element of a $6.7 billion International Monetary Fund package that helped Pakistan stave off a default in 2013. Though some have been sold, many privatisations were put off until after the next general election, most likely to be held in May 2018.",2016-10-17,0.0,0.0,0.3670105432202207,0.08817727970953777

4160,Crazy hike in Saudi visa fees could impact business ti,"strong>RIYADH: A seven-fold hike in visa fees to do business in Saudi Arabia risks deterring the foreign investment needed to transform its oil-dependent economy, diplomats and other sources say.</strongBut a senior Saudi business leader has dismissed such concerns, insisting the country´s most sought-after business partners could easily afford the new charges.""It´s incredibly short-sighted,"" a Riyadh-based diplomat said of the changes which took effect this month.""They´re obviously bleeding and they want to put the cost on foreigners as much as they can,"" he said, asking for anonymity. ""It´ll end up costing them a lot more than what they gain in visa payments.""Higher visa fees are one of many moves adopted by the kingdom to cover a loss in oil revenue which has slumped by 68 percent over the past five years, according to official data cited by Bloomberg News.But the higher cost of entry permits has left people ""scratching their heads"", a second diplomat said.""We are expecting to see business reconsider Saudi as a market,"" said the Western envoy. ""It´s certainly happening already,"" though not in a major way.Starting in October, a six-month business or work-visit visa allowing multiple entries costs 3,000 riyals ($800), compared with 400 riyals before, said Ala Siyam, general manager of Gulf Consulting House.The consultancy, in Khobar on the Gulf coast, assists clients from more than 40 countries in securing visas to Saudi Arabia, which requires all foreigners to have a local sponsor, whether to visit on holiday or business.Siyam told AFP the changes do not apply to the European Union or United States, while fees for British nationals have only slightly increased.Most other countries face the higher charges but also have a new option of applying for one or two-year visas. Those cost 5,000 riyals and 8,000 riyals each.Single-entry business visas are now priced at 2,000 riyals, several times higher than before.An oil industry source called the new tariffs ""crazy"" and a ""complete mistake"" if Saudi Arabia was seeking foreign partnerships.Since 2014, global oil prices have collapsed by about half, accelerating Saudi efforts to move away from petroleum which still accounts for the bulk of government income.In April, Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, 31, announced a ""Vision 2030"" reform programme to transform the world´s biggest oil exporter into a private-sector powerhouse with diverse industrial interests and major international investments.- Looking elsewhere -To promote job creation among Saudis and boost exports, Vision 2030 aims to foster small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) partly through ""international partnerships"".""This will be achieved by attracting both regional and international retail investors"", the Vision says.But higher visa fees will be a ""particular disincentive for SMEs"", including those wanting to assess the market or meet potential partners, the first diplomat said.He and the Western diplomat agreed that foreign companies will now be more likely to consider doing business, and even meeting, elsewhere.Abdulrahman al-Zamil, former chairman of the Council of Saudi Chambers, says the impact of the hike in visa fees is being exaggerated.""Most of those who are interested in our market.. can afford it. These are giant companies,"" said the head of Zamil Group, which employs 21,000 people in a range of sectors including steel fabrication and shipbuilding.""The Saudi market is not really attractive to small and medium"" enterprises from abroad, Zamil added.Siyam, whose company secured about 5,000 visas last year, predicted a small fall in the number of business visitors, with only non-essential staff left out of delegations.""This country, it´s a very important country, so I think those who want to come, they will still come,"" he said.",2016-10-21,0.9,-0.6,0.4017470624613481,0.0700006871435443

They plunged nearly 4 percent to $46.86 a barrel in the previous session.Brent for January delivery, the new front-month contract, was up 45 cents at $49.06 a barrel.

""We have been urging government and held several meetings with authorities... but so far they have not stopped this practice,"" Chaudhry told AFP.Government officials were not immediately available for comment.- Crowd control -The sight of containers in the streets have become an ubiquitous sign of stirring unrest in major cities since the tactic was first used in Karachi in 2007.Then, the government of General (retired) Pervez Musharraf sealed the megacity with containers to stop sacked chief justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry from addressing fellow lawyers.The next ""containerisation"", as the tactic is becoming known, came later that same year, when current Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif tried to return from exile in Saudi Arabia. He landed at Islamabad airport but was deported immediately on a special plane.The city of Rawalpindi, where Islamabad airport is situated, was locked down with containers in preparation.Since then containers have been freely used to control crowds, even those on routine religious marches.Containers are also used to create stages at political rallies and temporary residences and offices for leaders -- though in those cases they are usually paid for by the parties concerned.In 2014 Imran Khan joined forces with populist cleric Tahir-ul-Qadri to bring thousands of protesters to Islamabad for a sit-in outside parliament.The pair turned the government´s use of containers on its head: first, by embracing them as mobile offices, each having their own fully-equipped air-conditioned container with toilets, wifi and television.They also brought their own cranes and simply removed containers -- even those filled with earth and sand -- positioned by authorities to block their path to the high-security Red Zone in front of Parliament House.",2016-11-02,0.0,0.0,0.3938387635756058,0.12005534670008355

4186,Oil prices fall on persistent fuel supply overhang,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell in early trading on Friday, as the market refocused on a persistent fuel supply overhang that is not expected to abate unless OPEC and other producers make a significant cut to their output.</strongU.S. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were trading at $44.40 per barrel at 0120 GMT, down 26 cents, or 0.6 percent, from their last settlement, with a stronger dollar also weighing on prices.International Brent crude oil futures were down 17 cents, or 0.4 percent, at $45.67 a barrel.Traders said that an ongoing crude and refined product supply overhang that has dogged markets for over two years was weighing on markets.""Crude oil prices fell as the focus returned to supply growth. The IEA suggested prices may continue to retreat amid relentless supply growth unless OPEC makes significant supply cuts,"" ANZ bank said on Friday.The supply overhang could run into a third year in 2017 without an output cut from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), while escalating production from other exporters could lead to relentless supply growth, the International Energy Agency said on Thursday.In its monthly oil market report, the group said global supply rose by 800,000 barrels per day in October to 97.8 million bpd, led by record OPEC output and rising production from non-OPEC members such as Russia, Brazil, Canada and Kazakhstan.The IEA kept its demand growth forecast for 2016 at 1.2 million bpd and expects consumption to increase at the same pace next year, having gradually slowed from a five-year peak of 1.8 million bpd in 2015.Beyond oversupply, a surging dollar following the initial shock of Donald Trump's U.S. presidential election win also put pressure on prices, traders said.Because oil and refined products are traded in dollars, its import costs rise for any country using other currencies at home, potentially crimping demand.",2016-11-11,0.0,0.0,0.4517777777777778,-0.04744444444444444

""It encourages non-executive directors inclusion in the board and provisions for the manner of selection and maintenance of data bank of independent directors,"" the ministers said in a statement.It also aims at addressing the issues relating to protection of interest of minority shareholders and creditors.The new ordinance also introduces other reforms such as relaxations for free zone companies, registration of agricultural promotion companies for the development of agricultural sector and the establishment of Investor Education and Awareness Fund, the finance minister added.It also includes provisions for the registration of valuers dispute resolution mechanism through mediation and conciliation panel, passing of members resolution through circulation and simplified provisions for expeditious mergers and acquisitions.In addition, Dar said the Companies Ordinance 2016 emphasises maximum disclosures by Pakistanis to the local regulatory authorities in respect of investment in foreign companies.It also provides facilitation and regulation of the public sector enterprises.Under the new ordinance, the Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) will maintain Companies Global Register of Beneficial Ownership, which will have complete record of the beneficial ownership of the substantial shareholders and officers in local and foreign companies doing business in Pakistan, he added.Moreover, he said, it will be binding on the foreign company operating in Pakistan to provide complete information of its directors, officers and or beneficial owners.Dar said that to ensure adequate measures against fraud, money laundering and terrorist financing, the new ordinance empowers the SECP to investigate and also conduct joint investigations.Further, provisions requiring officers of a company to take adequate measures to curb such violations have also been included.The minister said the Companies Ordinance 2016 has been promulgated to provide relief and incentives to the corporate sector, especially small- and medium-sized companies and to give immediate impetus to the economy and stimulate economic growth.There was a need to revamp the 32 years old Companies Ordinance 1984 to provide an improved competitive legal framework for the corporate sector in Pakistan.The finance minister said during various stakeholder consultations, market experts and the business community had expressed unanimous support for enacting Companies Ordinance 2016 at the earliest, as it would help address the longstanding demands of the business community.The new ordinance will reduce the cost of incorporating and doing business, which will enable Pakistan's corporate sector to remain competitive in the international markets, he added.The finance minister appreciated the efforts of the SECP, Finance Ministry and various other stakeholders who made recommendations, leading to the finalisation and promulgation of the Companies Ordinance 2016. ",2016-11-13,0.09999999999999999,0.3333333333333333,0.2750855733413872,0.07047971408436525
4189,Cash bet could make break Modi,"strong>HONG KONG: Narendra Modi's banknote recall is becoming a make-or-break moment. India's prime minister is under fire after a move to cancel large-denomination rupee notes amounting to 86 percent of the total outstanding by value. The bold step to fight corruption has left Indians queuing outside bank branches since Wednesday to swap old notes for legal tender, bringing parts of the nation's economy to a standstill.</strongThe pain is most palpable for the informal sector, which accounts for almost half of GDP and the vast majority of employment. Tendering old notes above a minimal value for new ones requires a bank account, but 40 percent of the population is outside of the formal banking system. No wonder tensions are running high.If Modi can ride out the immediate backlash, though, demonetisation could potentially provide a big fiscal boost. Suppose that holders of one-fifth of the notes in circulation will not try to exchange them out of fear of attracting scrutiny from tax authorities. That means currency worth almost $50 billion, or 2 percent of GDP, could suddenly become worthless.In theory that would sharply reduce the monetary liabilities of the Reserve Bank of India, and brokerage Edelweiss reckons that in turn could allow the central bank to pay a higher dividend to the government. Other economists suggest this may not be legally possible, but the RBI does face pressure each year to boost its payouts to New Delhi.A windfall could help India boost spending while meeting its ambitious plan to narrow the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by March 2018. It would give Modi the funds for big-ticket items such as a recapitalization of the nation's ailing state-backed lenders, which could require more than $30 billion.The twin effects of a slowdown in economic activity and the reduction in money supply should also bring down inflation, making room for more interest rate cuts, which could boost growth in the medium term.The recall is certainly working: Banks have already collected a staggering $44 billion of deposits in barely five days. Modi clearly hopes that it will do the economy more good than harm once the initial shock of last week's move wears off. Either way, it could prove central to his legacy.",2016-11-14,0.0,0.0,0.423874802446231,0.12257438328866899

This zone would attract Chinese and other investment and it would be very near to Karachi and the proposed project of Keti Bandar for trade through sea and road routes.Murad Ali Shah said that his team led by Secretary Energy Agha Wasif had recently visited China to attend an important transport related meeting. They pleaded the case of Keti Bandar in the follow up meetings and now it has been included in the minutes of meeting which means the proposal of the project has been made official.The chief minister said that CPEC Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) meeting is scheduled to be held next month in China.

But people still want to do more of this trade. If you look at the U.S. markets, investors are looking at coming infrastructure spending and so on and they are rotating to stocks from bonds,"" said Yoshinori Shigemi, global market strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management in Tokyo.The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries slipped to 2.230 percent from Monday's 11-month high of 2.302 percent, although that is sharply above its levels around 1.86 percent before the election.U.S. retail sales rose more than expected in October, pointing to sustained economic strength that could allow the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates next month.U.S. interest rate futures are pricing in an 85 percent chance of a rate hike, compared to 75 percent before the election.Nikko SMBC Securities estimates U.S. two-year notes are currently pricing in five Fed rate hikes in the next two years, said senior strategist Makoto Noji.""If we base our assumption on (Fed Chair Janet) Yellen's gradualist approach, which can be roughly translated as two rate hikes per year, we could say that the market has already priced in tightening they could reasonably imagine at this point,"" he said.""But of course if Trump's policies stoke inflation that cannot be contained by two rate hikes per year, the U.S. bond market could see big moves again,"" he added.Sharp gains in U.S. bond yields are seen as boosting the attraction of dollars.The dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies hit its highest level in almost a year.It stood at 100.16, standing just 0.3 percent below its 13-year peak hit in December last year.The euro traded at $1.0724, just above Monday's $1.0709, its lowest level in almost a year.The U.S. currency fetched 109.03 yen, having hit 5 1/2-month high of 109.34 yen.Gold traded at $1,228.6 per ounce, not far from a 5 1/2-month low of $1,211.8 seen on Monday.The dollar's strength has fanned fears investors could shift their funds to the U.S. from emerging markets. Emerging market stocks managed to rise 0.3 percent on Tuesday after having fallen 7 percent over the previous four sessions.In contrast, oil prices hovered near their highest levels in about two weeks after having jumped nearly 6 percent on Tuesday on bets OPEC members will agree to cut output when they meet later this month.U.S. crude futures stood at $45.67 per barrel, after having risen to $46.09 late on Tuesday, their highest since Nov 2.",2016-11-16,0.4,0.8,0.4453472222222223,0.051440972222222235

4194,Iran overtakes Saudi Arabia top oil supplier Indi,"strong>NEW DELHI: Iran overtook political rival Saudi Arabia as India's top oil supplier in October, shipping data showed, just ahead of a producers' meeting this month to hammer out the details on output cuts aimed at reining in a global glut.</strongIran used to be India's second-biggest oil supplier, a position it ceded to Iraq after tough Western sanctions over its nuclear development programme limited Tehran's exports and access to finance.But India's oil imports from Iran have shot up this year after those sanctions were lifted in January. In October they surged more than threefold compared with the same month last year, rising to 789,000 barrels per day (bpd), according to ship tracking data and a report compiled by Thomson Reuters Oil Research and Forecasts.That compares to 697,000 bpd supplied last month by Saudi Arabia. Over the whole January to October period, though, Saudi Arabia still holds India's top supply spot, at an average of 830,000 bpd versus Iraq's 784,000 bpd and Iran's 456,400 bpd.Iran's surge to the No.1 spot is due partly to less available crude from Saudi Arabia, which has increased its capacity to refine oil instead of just exporting more crude.""Saudi Arabia's refining capacity has increased over time so it is not in a position to increase its exports further, whereas Iran is better placed to raise its output and sales to India,"" said Ehsaan Ul Haq of U.K.-based consultancy KBC Energy.The surge is also thanks to Iranian price discounts, which attracted purchases from India's programme to build up its strategic petroleum reserves (SPR). Last month India took in 2 million barrels of Iranian crude for the SPR stocks, and another 4 million barrels is expected to be shipped in November.In the first seven months of its fiscal year, between April and October, India imported 523,200 bpd from Iran, compared to 249,100 bpd for the same period a year ago.strong>RETURNING BUYERS</strongIndian refiners including Reliance Industries Ltd, operator of the world's biggest refinery complex at Jamnagar, that had stopped imports from Iran during the sanctions period have also returned as buyers of Iranian oil.Iran produces almost 4 million bpd of oil and exports 2.4 million bpd. Tehran's exports dropped to 1 million bpd during sanctions, down from a peak of almost 3 million bpd in 2011, before tougher Western sanctions were implemented.Gaining the top position as oil supplier to the world's third-biggest importer, even if only for one month, comes at a sensitive time.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) is due to meet on Nov. 30 to finalise a planned production cut aimed at propping up prices, which continue to languish below $50 per barrel due to oversupply.Exemptions to the planned cuts were given to Libya and Nigeria, where output has suffered from conflict, and sanctions-hit Iran. Given Iran has now pipped de-facto OPEC leader Saudi Arabia in India, those exemptions might be more difficult to defend during the upcoming meeting.",2016-11-17,0.5,0.5,0.4172994422994423,0.009255684255684262

It is not clear what happened to the initial $40 million in loans.strong>""FALSE ASSURANCES""</strongIn 2013, construction was dragging on, but the developer, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, promised it would be complete by the end of the year and OPIC approved the disbursement of the last funding, SIGAR reported in the letter.Marriott reportedly withdrew from the hotel and right after receiving the final loan funding, the developer told OPIC it was stopping all work on the project, SIGAR said.""Based on our inspections it is clear that the assurances made to obtain the final loan disbursement were false and misleading,"" investigators said. ""We are currently determining whether earlier representations made to justify the prior disbursements were also false and misleading.""To this day the hulking building sits empty, overlooking the U.S. Embassy which pays an untold amount of money to secure the structure, according to SIGAR.The same developer was also involved in a related project to build a neighbouring apartment complex with $27 million in OPIC loans, but construction there was also halted after the company received the last funding, SIGAR reported.""As with the hotel, we found that the apartment project was never finished and appears to be abandoned, and that representations made to OPIC that the building could open by August 2013 were blatantly false and unrealistic.""In a response to SIGAR, released along with the letter, OPIC said it was aware of ""issues"" with the building, but that at the time it believed the developer was making ""good faith efforts"" to complete the project.""As a lender, OPIC does not control the project, but has encouraged the project developer to find a third party to either purchase the project or provide additional funds to complete it,"" the agency said in its response.",2016-11-18,0.0,0.0,0.37290043290043284,-0.01691558441558443

Japan's Nikkei rose 0.3 percent as the yen continued to slip against the dollar.Trump's unexpected election victory has led to a major repricing of assets, with investors rushing to buy U.S. stocks and the dollar, while dumping bonds and emerging market assets.Carrying out even some of his plans for deregulation and tax cuts would undermine assumptions investors had long held - that the U.S. economy would grow modestly and inflation would remain tame in the foreseeable future.Trump's protectionism could hurt many of U.S. trade partners, including emerging markets which could see decline in exports to the U.S..To be sure, investors have little idea to what extent Trump can implement his proposals, including slapping tariffs on major trading partners such as China and Mexico and heavy tax cuts that would widen the U.S. fiscal deficit.Some investors think the market will have reality check as soon as differences between the new administration and Congress appear over some of Trump's policies.""Next week, we have events that would make investors more sober, such as OPEC meeting and Italian referendum. By then this Trump-inspired market may come to an end for now,"" said Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley Securities.Yet heightened uncertainty prompted investors to demand a larger premium for holding long-term U.S. debt, with the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield soaring to 2.364 percent by last week from around 1.86 percent before the elections.It last stood at 2.353 percent, with a rise above its 2015 peak of 2.5 percent seen as having potential to spark a further sell-off as bond prices fall.Higher U.S. yields are helping the dollar continue its bull run. The U.S. unit rose to as high as 111.125, its highest level since early June.

The culprits were not only tax dodgers, Stiglitz and Pieth said, but money launderers for a wide variety of criminal groups including a Russian child pornography ring.The official report calls for ""anti-corruption legislation that addresses acts performed by Panamanian nationals or economic groups established in Panama that directly or indirectly participate in the implementation of illegal activities in third countries.""",2016-11-22,0.45454545454545453,0.13636363636363635,0.3018790849673203,0.025081699346405213

4205,New LNG buyer Pakistan sees strong interest in giant tender,"strong>TOKYO: Pakistan LNG Ltd has received strong interest in its tender to buy as many as 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from suppliers hungry to sell gas in an oversupplied market, a senior official told Reuters on Thursday.</strongThe emergence of Pakistan as a large-scale buyer is a welcome boost in the market for the supercooled gas as demand slows in traditional big buyers like Japan. Spot Asian LNG prices LNG-AS have fallen by two-thirds since the beginning of 2014 as new supplies have flooded the market.Launched earlier this month, the tender for a combination of mid- and long-term shipments ""has been extremely well received,"" said Adnan Gilani, chief operating officer of state-owned Pakistan LNG.""The response is beyond what we thought,"" the executive said, speaking in an interview on the sidelines of an LNG conference in Tokyo. Gilani didn't identify any of the bidding suppliers.The company launched its tender to purchase a combined 240 shipments of liquefied natural gas (LNG),The mid-term tender covers a period of five years and calls for 60 shipments, while the long-term tender is for 15 years and 180 cargoes, according to information presented in the tender documents released on the company's website earlier this month.More than 20 global oil and gas majors and traders attended a bidders conference held by Pakistan LNG two days ago, Gilani said, adding as many as 10 more expressed interest without attending. The deadline for bidding is Dec. 20, he said.Pakistan LNG will launch a new tender for 4.5 million tonnes of LNG ""within a few months"", and six months later it will seek bids for another 4.5 million tonnes, he said.By 2019 Pakistan, which can only meet two-thirds of its gas demand, expects to be importing about 23 million tonnes of LNG a year via five terminals to fuel power stations and vehicles.""We are buying for our baseload needs,"" he said.

4206,Pakistans first DTH licences auctioned for Rs 1469 billi,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) completed the auction of all three licences for Pakistans first Direct to Home Service (DTH) after 15 hours of bidding in the wee hours of Thursday.</strongThe highest bid was raised by Mag Entertainment for Rs 4.91 billion, followed by M/s. Shahzad Sky for Rs 4.90 billion and M/s. Star time for Rs 4.89 billion respectively. A total of 11 companies  Orient Electronics Lahore, Mag Entertainment Lahore, Skyflix Islamabad, Smartimes Communications Islamabad, Sardar Builders Islamabad, Smart Sky Islamabad, Parus Media and Broadcast Islamabad, NayaTel Islamabad, Shahzad Sky, Islamabad, HB DTH Islamabad and IQ Communications Karachi  took part in the bidding process to secure the three licences.All the three licences were sold for Rs 14.69 billion, informed Chairman PEMRA Absar Alam, while speaking to the press.PEMRA Chairman congratulated the winning companies and said the initiative was going to be a game-changer for Pakistans electronic media industry.To date, this is the biggest investment in Pakistans electronic media history, he said and added as per the estimates and feasibility studies carried out by PEMRA experts, the overall investment would be $450 million ($150 million each) and could touch $750 million more in the next two years. These estimates did not include the bidding proceeds, he made it clear.The DTH service, he said, was a state-of-the art technology offering new dimensions of distribution system and a wide range of choice to consumers. The current analogue distribution system is offering a maximum of 80 channels while the DTH would increase the capacity to around 120 and each local DTH licence holder is expected to have at least 500,000 subscribers, said Absar Alam.Besides lucrative investment, the DTH regime would also make a significant contribution to job generation in the country leading to 15,000 jobs (5,000 by each company) i.e. new direct employment opportunities, he maintained.Absar Alam said the DTH service would not end the cable operators business, but would compel them to invest in technology and their distribution systems.However, the media watchdog issued non-exclusive licences for 15 years to the successful bidders after the open outcry bidding.Pakistani DTH services, once launched, will counter the sale of illegal Indian DTH services in Pakistan, which incur a heavy loss to the national exchequer because of transfer of between $200 million to $350 million to India annually on account of subscription fee. Now the legal DTH services will give consumers a choice against the current monopoly of cable operators as well.Pakistan has nearly 25 million electronic media subscribers and between three to five million consumers use Indian DTH illegally. After issuance of licences, subscribers of Indian DTH would have to shift to the local network.Similarly, foreign channels will get landing rights to come under the local regime through a regulatory process and launching of new local satellite channels will be allowed.The DTH licence holders will have to start operations within the year or risk termination of licences. The bidders are required to deposit 15 percent of the bid money at the outset of the bidding as earnest money, followed by 50 percent of the bid money upfront. The remaining amount could be paid immediately or in three yearly instalments at a mark-up rate.Each DTH licence holder is required to pay an annual fee of Rs10 million and contribute two percent of their gross revenue after the first three years of operations.Licenses to the bid winners would be awarded after clearance from the interior ministry and law enforcement agencies.",2016-11-24,0.3333333333333333,0.25,0.382520005247278,0.07040535222353404
4207,China to make extra 85 bn investments in Pakistan rail energy,"strong>LONDON: Pakistan has secured an additional $8.5 billion of investment from Beijing as part of the countries' joint energy, transport and infrastructure plan, Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal said on Wednesday.</strongThat is on top of the $46-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) project, which focuses on road building and energy infrastructure to end chronic power shortages in Pakistan and to link China's landlocked north-west with the deep-water port Gwadar on the Arabian Sea.Some $4.5 billion of the additional investment will be spent on upgrading tracks and signaling on Pakistan's main railway line from Karachi to Peshawar and increase the speed on the line to 160 km per hour from the current 60-80 kph, Iqbal told Reuters in an interview.Another $4 billion will go toward an LNG terminal and transmission line, he added.""This has now all been approved, so this is an additional $8.5 billion to the $46 billion we had already, so we are now close to $55 billion,"" Iqbal said.The International Monetary Fund said in June that repayments and profit repatriation from large-scale investments such as CPEC could add to Pakistan's medium- and long-term risks, predicting that the country's gross external financing needs would rise to $15.1 billion in 2018/2019 from $11.4 billion in the current financial year.But Iqbal said those risks would be countered by the economic boost the investment would give to industries such as steel, construction and engineering, pushing future annual growth to above 6 percent.In July the IMF upped its forecast for growth in Pakistan to 5 percent from 4.7 percent in the fiscal year to June 2017, citing China's investment plans.""As the economy grows, our capacity to undertake the responsibilities of repayments also improves, what really matters is that all of that investment is going into productive sectors,"" Iqbal said.Under CPEC, a number of new economic zones will be created along the corridor. Pakistan hopes that some industry will relocate from China, due to cheaper wages and production costs, Iqbal said.""Our preferred mode is joint ventures, because that will give a stake to both Pakistani and Chinese enterprises so now our government is actively promoting business-to-business links,"" he said.",2016-11-24,0.1,0.0,0.2518037518037518,0.05927128427128426

4211,OPEC scrambles agree crucial oil output cu,"strong>VIENNA: OPEC members will seek to give oil prices a boost in Vienna on Wednesday by nailing down their first output cut in eight years, although a deal is far from certain.</strongFailure to get an accord could send oil prices tumbling and reignite debate about the purpose of the 56-year-old Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.Not getting a deal ""could be the end of OPEC"", energy analyst Alexandre Andlauer told AFP. Pessimism about prospects for an agreement sent oil prices lower on Friday.In September the cartel agreed in principle to lower production to 32.5-33.0 million barrels per day (bpd), meaning a cut of between 600,000 and 1.1 million bpd.This, OPEC´s 14 members hope, will reduce the mammoth global supply glut and so increase the market price of oil from its current painful level of below $50 a barrel.It also marks a reversal of OPEC kingpin Saudi Arabia´s two-year-old strategy of flooding the market to squeeze out rivals, in particular US shale oil producers.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih, who was due in Vienna for the talks with other OPEC ministers, said this month an agreement was ""imperative"".strong>- Devil in the detail -</strongBut it remains to be agreed what size cuts, if any, each of OPEC´s members will make, particularly Iraq and Iran, the cartel´s next-biggest producers after Riyadh.Strife-torn Libya on Sunday ruled itself out of any cuts, arguing that it was in ""such a dangerous economic situation"" that there was no way it could take part.Iraq has said it will cut output but that it is short of money needed to fight Islamic State extremists. It also disputes with OPEC the level of its current output.Iran, newly free of export restrictions since last year´s nuclear deal, says it won´t cut production until it has reached pre-sanctions levels.Adding to the difficulties is the fierce rivalry between Shia Iran and Sunni Saudi Arabia, engaged in a proxy war in Yemen and backing different sides in Syria.strong>- Russia on board? -</strongAs the meeting has approached, OPEC members turned their sights on non-cartel producers, particularly Russia, for a pledge they would also tighten the taps.Securing a commitment from non-OPEC nations is important because the cartel only produces about a third of the world´s oil, meaning its ability to influence prices is limited.Algeria´s oil minister said in Iran this weekend that OPEC is prepared to cut production by 1.1 million bpd if non-members reduce by 600,000 bpd, local media reported.President Vladimir Putin said last week Russia was ready to ""freeze production"", but stopped short of promising a cut.Russia, its finances hit by low oil prices and Western sanctions, is pumping some 11 million bpd, more even than Saudi Arabia and at levels not seen since Soviet days.In a sign of ongoing tensions, Saudi Arabia pulled out of talks due Monday with non-OPEC producers including Russia ahead of the Vienna meeting, Bloomberg News reported.The news agency said Sunday that Algeria and Venezuela´s oil ministers would travel to Moscow on Monday to try to get Russia on board.strong>- Prices at the pump -</strongIf OPEC does manage to get a deal and oil prices rise -- though the increase may be modest -- then this will hit the wallets of billions of consumers worldwide.But higher oil prices might actually help the global economy, according to research by Goldman Sachs published by Bloomberg.This is because richer oil producers would then pump more liquidity into the global financial system.Low oil prices have blown a massive hole in producers´ finances in recent years, hurting not just more vulnerable OPEC members like Venezuela and Nigeria but even the Gulf states.Saudi Arabia, once seen as fabulously wealthy, is projecting a budget deficit of $87 billion in 2016. It has slashed spending and salaries and owes private firms billions of dollars.Two years of low prices have also hit investment in oil facilities, raising the prospect of supply problems in the medium term, experts say.",2016-11-28,1.0,0.0,0.42012345679012353,0.05043209876543211

West Texas Intermediate was up $3.98 at $49.21.The accord announced by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries is aimed at reducing a global supply glut that has kept prices painfully low.It represents a dramatic reversal from OPEC´s Saudi-led strategy, introduced in 2014, of flooding the market to pressure rivals, in particular US shale oil producers.The cartel will lower its monthly output by 1.2 million barrels per day (bpd) to 32.5 million bpd from January 1, Qatar´s energy minister and president of the OPEC conference said.""This is a major step forward and we think this is a historic agreement, which will definitely help rebalance the market and reduce the stock overhang,"" Mohammed Bin Saleh Al-Sada told a news conference in Vienna.He also said that the deal will help lift global inflation accelerate to a ""more healthy rate,"" including in the United States.It finalises a preliminary deal struck in September in Algeria when OPEC agreed to cut production but left the details to clear up later.Negotiations got bogged down in a game of poker between OPEC´s three biggest producers, Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, on who would do the heavy lifting.Iraq had said it did not want to pump less crude because it was short of money to fight Daesh extremists. It also disputed how much it actually produced.Iran has only been able to freely to export oil since last year´s nuclear deal came into force in January, and wants to return to pre-sanctions output levels.Fawad Razaqzada, a market analyst at Forex.com, said before OPEC´s announcement that Iran was ""playing a clever game"" against its arch rival.But Saudi Arabia also played hard-ball, saying it was prepared to leave the Austrian capital without a deal.Energy Minister Khaled al-Falih had said recovering demand will boost prices next year -- cut or no cut.Even though expectations were therefore low, failure to get a deal would have sent oil prices tumbling, perhaps as low as $30 per barrel, analysts had said.Also it would have reignited debate about the very purpose of OPEC, 56 years after its creation.",2016-12-01,0.3333333333333333,0.25,0.3917397660818715,-0.04265350877192983

4219,Oil prices fall as production creeps u,"strong>SINGAPORE: Oil prices fell by one percent on Monday as a higher U.S. rig count unsettled markets amid nagging concern that output cuts, planned as part of concerted action between producer club OPEC and Russia, might not be as big as initially anticipated.</strongBrent crude futures were trading at $53.89 per barrel at 0132 GMT, down 57 cents, or over 1 percent, from their last close.West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were at $51.49 a barrel, down 52 cents, or 1 percent.Traders said price falls were triggered by rising production just after last week's accord between the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC member Russia to cut output in 2017. The cuts aim to rein in a supply glut that has weighed on markets for over two years.Meanwhile U.S. energy firms extended drilling for new oil production into a seventh month last week, data from energy services firm Baker Hughes showed on Friday.""The U.S. oil rig count continued its rally this week, up by 3 rigs...Since its trough on May 27, 2016, producers have added 161 oil rigs (+51 percent) in the U.S.,"" Goldman Sachs said.Overall - accounting for the recent rise in oil drilling, but also for cutbacks earlier this year on low prices - Goldman said ""year-on-year production will decline by 620,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2016 and increase by 55,000 bpd in 2017"".With U.S. production set to edge up, there are also gnawing concerns that the cuts announced last week by OPEC and Russia might not be as deep as initially anticipated. The planned reductions brought the sharpest weekly crude price rises in years.Russia on Friday reported average daily oil production of 11.21 million bpd for November - its highest in almost 30 years.And while Moscow has agreed to cut its output by 300,000 bpd in early 2017, it said it would do so against November levels.

The fact that Nigeria and Libya were exempt from the deal due to production-denting civil strife will further pressure OPEC leader Saudi Arabia to shoulder the bulk of supply reductions.Saudi Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih said the kingdom may be willing to cut to below 10.058 million bpd next year.",2016-12-12,0.45454545454545453,0.13636363636363635,0.41000000000000003,-0.02071428571428571

There is a possibility that the open attitude toward India joining the CPEC will quickly be overwhelmed by opposition voices from Pakistan if New Delhi does not respond in a timely manner to the general's overture, the op-ed piece noted.The ongoing dispute over Kashmir between India and Pakistan makes New Delhi vigilant about the $46 billion project as it will reportedly pass through Azad Jammu and Kashmir. However, like Pakistan, India's primary strategy is to promote economic and social development. The best way to reduce hostilities is by establishing economic cooperation based on mutual benefits to put aside what cannot be reached by a consensus.China has no intention of using the CPEC as strategic leverage to intervene in Pakistan and India's dispute. On the contrary, China is likely to adopt an open attitude toward India joining the CPEC and would be happy to see more friendly interactions between the two South Asian neighbors. The CPEC has long been seen as a flagship project in China's Belt and Road initiative and India's involvement would be conducive in pushing forward the initiative.India's economy has reportedly overtaken its former colonial ruler, the UK, to become the sixth-largest in the world by GDP. Now it seems the emerging economy is pushing past these current achievements. India is ramping up efforts to integrate itself into global manufacturing chains, and as such will need to boost regional economic integration and open new international trade routes to build an export-oriented economy.India could boost its exports and slash its trade deficit with China via new trade routes that would be opened up by the CPEC. In addition, the northern part of India bordering Pakistan will gain more economic growth momentum if India joins the project. It is understandable that cooperation between the traditional rivals may make India uncomfortable. However, New Delhi's attitude toward Pakistan's gesture can be a touchstone for the country's determination and courage in becoming a greater economic power.",2016-12-23,0.0,0.0,0.37656680440771345,0.15249655647382923
4236,Airbus seals deal with Iran for sale of 100 aircraf,"strong>PARIS: Europe's Airbus signed a firm contract on Thursday to sell 100 jets to IranAir, completing a return by Western plane giants and paving the way for deliveries to start next month, a year after sanctions against Iran were lifted.</strongThe deal took weeks of shuttling between Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, France, and Tehran, complicated by a shortage of expert legal advice as Iran completes its biggest commercial deals with the West since its 1979 Islamic revolution.Confirming details first reported by Reuters, Airbus said almost half the jets would be for short to medium routes and that deliveries would start early next year.The contract includes 46 of the narrrow-body A320 family which includes the A321 model, 38 long-haul A330s and 16 of Europe's newest long-range model, the A350.Such a deal would be worth $18-20 billion at list prices, depending on variants flown, but Iran is expected to receive steep discounts from foreign manufacturers as its aviation renewal coincides with a drop in demand elsewhere.The head of IranAir was quoted earlier as saying the value of the contract would not exceed $10 billion.It is expected to be followed by a formal deal to buy turboprop aircraft from ATR, half-owned by Airbus.The breakthrough comes days after Iran signed a $17 billion deal with Boeing for 80 jets and is expected to sharpen efforts by the U.S. company to persuade the incoming U.S. administration to allow the trade to go ahead, aviation experts said.The first jet, an Airbus A321 already painted in IranAir livery, may arrive before the Jan. 20 inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump, who has opposed an international deal to lift sanctions in return for curbs on Iran's nuclear activities.""When Airbus and ATR aircraft start going into Iran, Boeing will point to that to argue that it should implement its own deal,"" said an aviation source who closely followed the talks.Boeing declined to comment.MOVING QUICKLYDespite rivalries, the Airbus and Boeing deals with Iran are unusually intertwined because each depends on continued U.S. clearances for the sale of planes built with U.S. parts.""Everyone has an interest in moving quickly. The Iranian government wants to show results from the nuclear deal; Airbus wants to get deliveries moving and Boeing wants the leverage it can get from European deliveries to Iran,"" another source said.The ability to renew Iran's ageing and accident-prone fleet is widely viewed as a test of the pragmatist policies of Iranian President Hassan Rouhani ahead of presidential elections in May.Airbus said the deal was subject to U.S. Treasury export licences granted in September and November 2016.Republican critics of the nuclear pact want Trump to block the aircraft deals and have sought to hamper them by voting to tighten restrictions on use of the U.S. financial system.Airbus is expected to be paid in euros instead of the usual dollars and is likely to provide its own financing for the first few jets, adding to cash strains caused by a spike in customer financing for Turkey this year.Planemaking chief Fabrice Bregier called the deal ""a significant first step"" in modernising Iranian aviation, adding it included training, airport operations and air traffic management.However, both sides confirmed the Airbus A380 had been jettisoned from a provisional list first agreed in January.",2016-12-23,0.0,0.0,0.36196581196581196,0.07307692307692305

I want to reassure our people that foreign currencies will not keep going up,"" Rouhani said in a live interview with state television.Iran's rial hit a record low against the U.S. dollar last Monday in a sign of concern about the country's ability to attract foreign money after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20.If the rial's weakness continues, it could become a political issue ahead of Iran's presidential election in May by threatening some of Rouhani's economic achievements. Rouhani, who took office in 2013, is expected to seek re-election but has not announced it officially.Economists have said Trump's election in November was a major factor in the rial's weakness. He has said he will scrap the deal between Iran and world powers that imposed curbs on Tehran's nuclear projects and lifted sanctions on the Iranian economy last January.""The dollar has gained against all currencies in the past few months and it is natural if it also gains in Iran. But the rate of exchange of foreign currencies will certainly not remain at current levels,"" Rouhani said, without giving details of how the government plans to defend the rial.""The stability of (currency) markets is important for the government. The economy has to be predictable so that exporters and importers can act with trust,"" he said.Before Rouhani's remarks, the rial strengthened to about 39,000 to the dollar on the free market on Sunday, after sliding to an all-time low of 41,500 last Monday.The rial's gains came after central bank Governor Valiollah Seif told state television on Saturday that he saw 36,000 rials per dollar as a ""realistic"" rate.Seif was quoted as telling lawmakers that the central bank was injecting $5.8 billion in the market to defend the rial.The currency traded at 35,570 in mid-September. Before December, the record low was about 40,000, hit in late 2012, traders said.Rouhani's administration stabilized the currency after years of volatility, which helped bring inflation down to single-digit rates from above 40 percent.Besides the free market exchange rate, Iran uses an official rate, now at 32,375, for some state transactions.",2017-01-02,0.0,0.0,0.32454117063492066,0.011807246572871574

We decided to close down rather than losing money every day,"" he said.Only those manufacturers which invested heavily in their own energy production survived.These include plants run by the Sadaqat company, which provides house linen to major Western retailers such as Debenhams, Tesco and Target. Energy supply to huge printing, cutting and sewing departments is rotated according to need.""We have three sources of electricity: the main and cheapest one is generation through gas, if we don´t have gas, we go to Wapda (the public utility), if Wapda closes, we go to diesel generators,"" says chairman Mukhtar Ahmed.""I have no choice. If I stop producing, we lose our customers.""Smaller plants, notably the hundreds of thousands of cotton loom workshops, lack backup generators and are dependent on the public network.- ""No power, no wages"" -Each time the power cuts, work is interrupted.""We loom workers only get paid if there is power and looms are running. If there is no power, there are no wages,"" said Mohammad Rizwan, a 21-year-old weaver.The government has promised to end power cuts by 2018, and said industry would be prioritised.In the past few weeks, the biggest manufacturers in Faislabad have been supplied without interruption.""The key is that they give us 24 hours of electricity a day,"" said Wahid Raamay, chairman of the Council of Loom Owners in Faisalabad.Despite these important advancements, textiles are not yet out of danger. As the country´s electricity supply has improved, natural gas imports bills have gone up with the increased cost passed down to consumers.Bharara estimates the cost of electricity has doubled over eight years, from six rupees per kilowatt/hour to 11.That´s still much lower than 26 rupees per kilowatt hour for electricity produced by a diesel generator, but more than costs in competing countries.""At this time we are struggling to give competitive power,"" admits Muhammad Salim Bhatti, general manager of the city´s power distribution company. ""Over time, we will become cheaper as new power plants will be more efficient"", he hopes. ""We´ll be in a position to compete.""But the Asian Development Bank is less optimistic, citing the opaqueness of large-scale Chinese investment in the country´s energy infrastructure.""The power due to be produced by Chinese-built power plants is expected to be expensive"" it said, though it anticipates it will still be cheaper than the thermal plants they are set to replace.In late December, Pakistan´s fourth nuclear power plant went online, built with Chinese assistance as part of Islamabad´s plans to produce 8,800 MW from atomic energy by 2030.Total exports, meanwhile, 60 percent of which are made up by textiles, declined by 13 percent in the first nine months of this year compared to last, a sign that the industry´s recovery is yet to begin.",2017-01-08,0.0,0.0,0.4069246385422855,0.02748861160625866

4285,Taiwan economy rallies thanks to electronics demand,"Taipei: Taiwan´s economy notched up its best performance in almost two years in the final quarter of 2016, with strong demand for electronics offsetting a plunge in mainland tourists, according to official data released Wednesday.Growth was 2.58 percent year-on-year in the September-December period, the fastest expansion since the first-quarter of 2015 when the economy grew 4.01 percent.It was the third consecutive quarter of growth since Taiwan came out of recession in April-June last year.Traditionally an export-driven technology hub, the island is home to industry giants such as Foxconn and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) -- key suppliers for Apple´s iPhone.President Tsai Ing-wen is pushing for Taiwan to foster its own ""Asian Silicon Valley"" as one of her five initiatives to kickstart the economy.The statistics bureau said exports in the quarter increased 11.73 percent -- the most in five years -- driven by a boom in demand for electronics parts.TSMC also announced earlier this month better-than-expected earnings in the same period thanks to the launch of the iPhone 7 series.""Production of electronic components continue to increase, driven by the expansion of smart technology product applications,"" the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics said in a statement Wednesday.However, growth has been dampened by slowing tourism from mainland China, that saw a drop of 40.39 percent in the fourth quarter.The number of Chinese visitors has fallen since Beijing-sceptic Tsai was elected last January, with speculation China is turning off the taps as a means of pressure on the Taiwanese leader.Local tourism operators who once catered to droves of mainland tourists complain of half-empty hotels and tour buses sitting idle.While tourism to Taiwan from other countries rose 17.47 percent in the fourth quarter, overall visitor numbers still declined 3.99 percent.Analysts are also concerned about whether the strong export demand will continue. <br/> ""With weak global demand set to drag on exports and limited scope for more policy support, the recovery is likely to run out of steam soon,"" Capital Economics economist Gareth Leather said, according to Bloomberg News.Wednesday´s release brings 2016 full-year growth to 1.4 percent, beating the government´s estimate of 1.35 percent.It is forecasting economic growth of 1.87 percent in 2017.",2017-01-25,0.2,0.2,0.3872947454844006,0.13825944170771756
4286,WTO 1 trillion global trade treaty,"strong>GENEVA: A trade accord that will boost global exports by $1 trillion should come into force within two weeks, the head of the World Trade Organization said on Thursday, just as the rhetoric of U.S. President Donald Trump clouds the outlook for global trade.</strongThe Trade Facilitation Agreement (TFA) will have a major impact on poorer countries, because it standardises and simplifies customs procedures, slashing the time, cost and complexity of taking goods over borders.""In the WTO's history, it is the biggest agreement we ever reached,"" WTO Director-General Roberto Azevedo told Reuters in an interview.Jordan, Chad and Kuwait are all poised to ratify, which would tip the agreement over the required mark of 110 WTO members to take effect, Azevedo said.""There are estimates that once fully implemented, this could have an impact of around 2.7 percentage points on trade expansion throughout the world every year until say 2030, and half a percentage point of GDP growth around the world.""Where a product may previously have taken 6-7 weeks to arrive, the waiting time should be cut to a few days.""Things are going to cross the border much more easily, much more transparently and at lower costs,"" Azevedo said.""If its truly implemented and done well, there will be almost no contact between the client and the (customs) authority,"" Azevedo said. ""When that happens the room for corruption basically disappears. And we know that at the border, corruption is a problem for many countries.""The United States, European Union, China and Japan were among the early adopters, although big and rich countries have less to gain since their customs procedures are already at high levels.Asked if the deal was the high point of global trade liberalisation, the veteran Brazilian trade negotiator said there was still a ""rich agenda"" of potential trade reforms, including for investment, services and small business.Azevedo said it was too early to tell whether the new U.S. administration would be on board with those reforms, adding that much of what was being said about Trump's plans for trade was speculation inferred from his previous comments.Trump has advocated an ""America first"" stance, and talked of introducing border taxes to stop manufacturing jobs going to Mexico or China, prompting fears of a trade war between major economic blocs.strong>""VERY BAD SCENARIO""</strongAzevedo said there could be an increase in trade disputes, and the WTO was ready to handle them.""A lot of concerns Ive heard in recent political debates in the United States can be addressed by tools that we have here in the WTO.""But a trade war that involved ignoring the rules-based system would be a ""very bad scenario"".The outlook for world trade growth was hard to foresee because of conflicting signals, Azevedo said, with some people worried about a trade war and others anticipating an accelerating U.S. economy and improving business environment.The WTO is also an important arena for Britain's discussions about its exit from the European Union, because the EU looks after Britain's rights and obligations as a trading entity at the WTO. Britain must disentangle itself so it can negotiate as a separate entity at the WTO.""I suppose, from what I hear, that it is going to take a couple of years, at least. At that point in time they will begin to negotiate with WTO members,"" Azevedo said.Asked if that might interfere with Britain's plan to leave the EU in two years, he said: Timing is not in my hands. Its in members hands  and the political decision to initiate things.Britain could start to negotiate with WTO members sooner, Azevedo said, but he had not heard of such negotiations and he had not been approached to facilitate anything.",2017-01-27,0.0,0.0,0.3539886363636363,0.01882575757575759
4287,Iran oil exports rise slightly Feb sour,"strong>TOKYO: Iran's monthly oil exports are set to climb slightly in February, as Indonesia takes its first shipment since sanctions on Tehran were lifted last year, a person with knowledge of Iran's tanker loading schedule said.</strongVolumes remain below last September's high, however, suggesting that Iran has had difficulty finding more buyers for its oil, even after being exempt from production cuts agreed by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other exporters last November.Traders had expected it to raise output slightly and boost exports to reclaim market share.Crude and condensate exports for February will be just over 2.20 million barrels per day (bpd), up from 2.16 million bpd this month, which is the lowest rate since July, the person said. Exports rose to as high as nearly 2.6 million bpd in September.While crude and condensate exports have slipped, Iran is planning to significantly boost oil product exports this year as it refurbishes refineries, said Abbas Kazemi, Iran's deputy minister of petroleum and president of its national oil refining company NIORDIC.""In 2017 I see about 600,000 barrels per day of oil product exports. That is the plan,"" Kazemi told Reuters at an oil conference in Tokyo on Thursday.Products will include fuel oil, gasoil and kerosene, he said.Crude oil loadings for Asia, where Iran's biggest customers are located, are set to rise to a three-month high of nearly 1.5 million bpd in February. Loadings for January, meanwhile, have been running a little above 1.46 million bpd.Indonesia is expected to lift nearly 34,000 bpd in February, according to the source.Exports to Europe are set to total a little more than 610,000 bpd in January and nearly 590,000 in February, compared with a high of almost 800,000 bpd in December, the most since the sanctions were lifted.The Netherlands is lifting its first crude and loading nearly 70,000 bpd this month, according to the source. It earlier bought condensate from Iran.That ties in with information from oil trading and shipping sources who told Reuters that two Iranian-owned oil tankers are sailing to Rotterdam, the heart of northern Europe's refining and trading hub.The development shows Iran breaking through yet another barrier in its bid to regain oil market share lost during years of international sanctions that hindered its sale of crude oil and condensates to the international market.Iran had been ramping up shipments of oil on foreign owned tankers since restrictions on ship insurance were eased last April. They will be eased further from next month.In the last month supertankers owned by Greek and Croatian owners have hauled Iranian crude from Kharg Island to Spain, Italy and Thailand according to ship tracking data on the Reuters Eikon terminal.Italy is loading about 32,000 bpd in January and nearly 110,000 bpd in February, while Spain is loading a similar amount in January and just above 70,000 bpd in February.""Italy and Spain used to be quite enthusiastic buyers of Iranian crude ...

4294,Morocco warns EU over trade d,"RABAT: Morocco´s government on Monday warned the European Union that its failure to fully implement an agriculture deal with Rabat would have severe consequences and could spur illegal migration.The North African nation and the European Union signed in 2012 a multi-million-euro fishing and agriculture trade agreement.Two years later the deal was quashed by a European court after a challenge from the Polisario Front which seeks independence for the disputed territory of Western Sahara.But the EU´s top court of justice overturned that verdict in December 2016, setting the stage for the reinstatement of the agreement although the ruling did not say so explicitly.Morocco´s agriculture and fisheries ministry said in a statement Monday that the last ruling ""in all logic confirms the (2012) trade protocol which must be fully implemented"".Failure to do so would affect ""thousands of jobs"" both in Morocco and in Europe.Furthermore it could spur ""a new flow of migration"" towards Europe and place the continent ""at risk"" and would force Morocco to make a ""decisive choice"", the statement said, without elaborating.The warning comes days after EU leaders held a summit in Malta for talks that also focused on how to deal with a feared upsurge of migrant smuggling, including from Africa.Although most migrants from sub-Saharan African seeking a new life in Europe have been travelling through chaos-riddled Libya, others have managed in recent years to enter Spain from Morocco.Spain has two enclaves in North Africa -- Ceuta and Melilla -- surrounded by hi-tech border fences that are regularly stormed by migrants. Many have died tried to climb them, some shot by Moroccan forces.Other migrants, most of them from sub-Saharan Africa, take to rickety boats to try to cross the narrow stretch of sea between Morocco and Spain´s southern tip.According to the International Organization for Migration, 13,246 migrants arrived in Spain last year, more than 8,100 of whom came by sea.",2017-02-06,0.0,0.0,0.211222804972805,0.07316919191919193

In November COMAC said it had received 570 orders from 23 customers.China is one of the Western manufacturers´ key battlegrounds, with its travellers taking to the skies in ever-growing numbers.The country´s airlines will need nearly 6,000 new planes worth $945 billion over the next two decades, Airbus said in its 2016-2035 Global Market Forecast.Boeing´s expectations are even more optimistic, for 6,800 aircraft costing $1 trillion.To win favour locally both have built partnerships with Chinese firms, even as Beijing hopes to oust them with homegrown aircraft.Airbus has a completion and delivery centre in Tianjin, where workers install furnishings and apply paint to aircraft for the domestic market. It also buys parts such as exit doors, brake blades and wing sections from Chinese suppliers.Boeing last year announced plans to open a facility with COMAC to paint and install cabins for 737-model planes, the Chinese firm said.COMAC has also developed a smaller regional jet, the ARJ21, which took to the skies in its first commercial flight last June.",2017-02-06,0.42857142857142855,0.21428571428571427,0.24740530303030303,0.07924242424242424

Also moved is the stake of around 7 percent in Turk Telekom.State-owned enterprises including Ziraat Bank, natural gas distributor BOTAS, the PTT Turkish post office and the state tea producer are also being moved to the wealth fund.The fund was established in August 2016 but this is the first time that significant businesses have been transferred under its control. It was already controlling horse racing and lottery assets.Ozgur Altug, economist at BGC Capital in Istanbul, said he estimated the value of the transferred assets to be $33 billion. The change means that the fund will receive dividends from the assets rather than the government budget, he said in a note to clients.Turkey is following in the steps of several countries in putting key national assets into a sovereign wealth fund, which can be used for major projects, maintaining pensions and national welfare programmes, or in times of crisis.But Ankara´s fund is well behind the biggest sovereign wealth funds in Norway, the Gulf and China.Norway´s sovereign wealth fund is the world´s largest, worth $892 billion and holding stakes in around 9,000 companies worldwide.When Turkey´s fund was founded in August, the state-run Anadolu news agency said it would be used to fund ""mega projects"" such as the planned Istanbul shipping canal and a new three-level tunnel under the Bosphorus.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan fondly refers to such plans as his ""crazy projects"" aimed at transforming infrastructure to create a ""new Turkey"".Anadolu said in August the fund aimed eventually to have a value of $200 billion.",2017-02-06,0.0,0.0,0.47940115440115444,0.06715367965367965

PPP determines the economic productivity and standards of living of various countries over a period. Since market exchange rates fluctuate substantially, many economists consider PPP as a more precise way of estimating a countrys economy.The consulting firm also predicted 2050 GDP numbers based on market exchange ratings, an alternative method for GDP calculation. In these rankings, the US will lose global dominance by 2030, and the gap will only grow by 2050 with China having a nearly $50 trillion GDP, and the US having the same $34.1 trillion.Following is the list of top 32 economies by 2030:01.

4300,Enjoy the first movers advantage Nawaz advises business leader,"strong>ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday said Pakistan was set on track of sustainable growth and was ready to do business with the world.</strongPakistan with its sixth largest population in the world, 80 million middle class, blessed with human and natural resources, strategically located, politically stable, offering attractive policies is a destination no global player can miss, the prime minister said in a meeting with heads of international organizations, here at the PM Office.The group of corporate leaders that attended the meeting belonged to the United States, Australia, China, United Kingdom, Canada, Italy, France, Spain, Sweden, Singapore, Germany, South Korea and Switzerland.The prime minister urged upon the foreign businessmen to avail the countrys investment potential and enjoy the first movers advantage.Nawaz Sharif apprised the businessmen that Pakistans economic conditions were improving continuously with an objective to achieve 5 percent GDP growth rate from the current 3 percent.He said the government was aimed at achieving sustainable economic growth and mentioned several steps taken in this regard including strengthened tax administration, rationalize untargeted annual subsidies and widened social safety nets.He said these steps reinforced macroeconomic policies, which resulted in lower budget deficit, increased foreign exchange reserves, and low spending on energy subsidies.The prime minister said the government was cognizant of the need for a comprehensive and contemporary policy framework that supported macroeconomic stability.We are well aware that international investors need stable markets backed by clear and consistent policies. We are committed to maintaining an enabling policy framework to attract foreign direct investment, he said.He said the Vision 2025 mapped Pakistan to join the top 25 economies in the world leading to Upper Middle Income country status by 2025.He said the countrys economy was targeted to grow over 8 percent between 2018 and 2025 while maintaining single digit inflation.He mentioned that PricewaterhouseCoopers had placed Pakistan at 20 in its projected list of 32 most powerful economies of the world in 2030.The prime minister said as a result of sustained commitment to reform, key economic indicators had improved since the government was elected in 2013.Over the past three years, the government brought down the fiscal deficit from 8.6 to 4.2 percent, increased Tax-to-GDP ratio from 9.8 to 12.4 percent and investment to GDP ratio from 14.9 to 15.2 percent, he added.He mentioned that inflation had been contained which had earlier touched 1.6 percent in October 2015 and had remained well under 3 percent since then.He said industrial sector showed remarkable performance and registered a growth of 6.8 percent during 2015-16 and was poised to do even better this year and onwards.Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said since he came into office in 2013, the economy faced severe energy shortages, inflationary pressures, exchange rate volatility and a precarious security environment.He said however at present, the consumer market in Pakistan was growing at a very fast pace including automobiles, housing, electronics, telecommunication, hospitality and online-retails sectors.He said Pakistan was emerging as an expanding market for the US and European products.He mentioned that the government had devised a comprehensive plan to create investment friendly environment, particularly liberalized investment policies to welcome foreign investments.We offer incentives to attract new capital inflows, including tax exemptions, tariff reductions, infrastructure, and investor facilitation services, he said.He said the Investment Policy (2013) focused at reducing the cost of doing business in Pakistan, easing business with creation of industrial clusters and Special Economic Zones to attract foreign direct investment, all protected by legislation.Nawaz Sharif said Pakistan Stock Exchange had been created to lower fragmentation of the market and bring it at par with global markets.The bench mark index PSE100, crossed 49,000 in January 2017 and is touching new heights. Recently, 40 percent strategic shares of Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) were sold to a Chinese consortium, he added.He pointed that this divestment was the first such sale in a bourse in the regional markets and it also marks first venture of Chinese bourse outside China.The PM also apprised the foreign businessmen of Pakistans strategic location on Asias premier trade, energy and transport corridor.It is also the gateway to the energy rich Central Asian States, the financially liquid Gulf States and the economically advanced Far Eastern economies, he said.He said China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) was a key regional initiative for connectivity and shared prosperity of nations.He said under CPEC, a portfolio of over US$55 billion had already been implemented while investment of more than US$35 billion in the energy sector was also being implemented.He said the corridor would substantially shorten transportation distances between Africa and Middle-East to Central and South Asian regions.The prime minister said international economic agencies were upgrading ratings for the financial and economic stability of Pakistan.He mentioned that Standard &amp; Poor (S&amp;P) had upgraded its forecast of average annual GDP growth from 4.7 to 5 percent, World Bank forecast a GDP growth of 5.2 percent for 2016-17, S &amp; P also expected Pakistans debt to fall below 60 percent of GDP by 2018.The CEOs from UK included Henry Cookson, MD Henry Cookson Adventures, Britain; Julia Charlotte Chastel De Boinville, Clint Programme Manager Afiniti; George Justin Murray, MD Afiniti; Christopher Malcolm Farmer, EVP Afiniti; Thomas Hampden Inskip, MD Afiniti; Archibald Soames, Sr Manager Afiniti; Julian Lopez Portillo, Client Programme Manager Afiniti and Max Cooper Lintott, Client Program Manager Afiniti.The business leaders from USA included Muhammad Ziaullah Khan Chishti, CEO the Resource Group and Hassan Afzal, Chief Technology Officer Afiniti.The business leaders from Italy included Alessandro Benetton, CEO Benetton Autostrade Pvt Equity; Carlo D Amelio, CEO Sant Anna-Holding Ibl Bancal-Spa; Fabio Corsico, Govt Affairs Director Kolon Group; Marco Alvera, CEO Snam; Cecilia Braggiotti, MD Afiniti and Lucia Baresi, Client Programme Manager Afiniti.The CEOs from China included Sichen Huang, Afiniti Advisor; Guo Ping, CEO Huawei; Linchun Chin, Youghi Yang, Jin Yi Hugo Ou, Non ED Sinolink Worldwide Holdings, China.The CEOs from other countries included Raymond Lee, Owner Kolon Group (South Korea); Rob Rankin, Chairman Consolidated Press Holdings and Roy Wyatt Beau, Client Programme Manager Afiniti (Australia); Lai Chang Wen, CEO Ninja Van and Li Huanwu, GM Afiniti and Hua Qianni, Centre Director (East China) (Singapore Consulate); Tanguy Catlin, Senior Partner Mckinsey and Jerome Geo.M.F.de la Croix de Castries, Country Manager Afiniti (France); Alonso Aznar Botella, Silent Programme Manager (Spain); Benedict Constantin Faber, GM Afiniti (Germany); Michel Grorges Portenier, EVP Afiniti (Switzerland); Timothy Gordon Raymond Nixon, GM Afiniti (Canada); Justyna Hanna Kozicki (Sweden) and Ali Raza Siddiqi, Director JS Group and Nadeem A.

4304,Trudeau says Canada EU must lead world economy,"strong>STRASBOURG: Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Thursday that the whole world benefited from a strong European Union and that the bloc and his country needed to lead the international economy in challenging times.</strongTrudeau told the European Parliament that the Union was an unprecedented model for peaceful cooperation in a speech that marked his distance from both the United States under new President Donald Trump, who has questioned the value and future of the bloc, and from Britain, which has voted to leave it.An effective European voice on the global stage was not just preferable, but essential, Trudeau said.""You are a vital player in addressing the challenges that we collectively face as an international community,"" he told EU lawmakers a day after they backed an EU-Canada free trade deal. ""Indeed the whole world benefits from a strong EU.""Trudeau, who will also visit Germany, said that Canada and the European Union shared a belief in democracy, transparency and the rule of law, in human rights, inclusion and diversity.""We know that, in these times, we must choose to lead the international economy, not simply be subject to its whims,"" he said, according to a text made available in advance of his speech, adding both parties had shown they valued trade and a belief that it could bring prosperity to their citizens.With the passage of their trade deal, Canada and the European Union offer a counter to Trump, who has withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and wants to rework the North American Free Trade Agreement.For Canada the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA) is important to reduce its reliance on the neighbouring United States as an export market.For the EU, it is a first trade pact with a G7 country and a success to hail after months of protests at a time when the bloc's credibility has taken a beating from Britain's vote last June to leave.Trudeau's speech, in English and French, got a warm welcome from lawmakers in Strasbourg as he signalled Canada's distance from both its big neighbour to the south under Trump and from London, where Brexit supporters argue that ties to Britain's old empire can help expand trade once out of the European Union.Both Canada and the EU, said Trudeau, needed to ensure that their Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA), set to enter force in months, worked for people.""If we are successful, CETA will become the blueprint for all ambitious, future trade deals. If we are not, this could very well be the last. So make no mistake, this is an important moment for us.""Trudeau said many people were worried that the current system only benefited society's luckiest few and that this was a valid concern.Trade, he said, must be inclusive, so that everyone benefited.""And this agreement ... delivers just that.""",2017-02-16,0.0,0.0,0.3590617715617715,0.18819930069930071

4306,Oil prices slip as high stocks overshadow OPEC cu,"strong>LONDON: Oil slipped on Friday, pressured by growing global stocks, while expectations that an oil output cut by producers might eventually balance the market helped to underpin prices.</strongBrent crude futures were trading at $55.57 per barrel at 0945 GMT, 8 cents below their last close.U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude futures were down 4 cents at $53.32 per barrel.Both appeared on track for losses on the week, though prices had moved higher earlier in the session in response to news that producer group OPEC could extend an output cut aimed at reining in a global supply overhang.The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and other producers, including Russia, plan to cut output by almost 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd) during the first half of 2017, and estimates suggest compliance by OPEC is around 90 percent.The cuts are aimed at curbing oversupply that has dogged markets since 2014.But inventories and supplies remain high, especially in the United States.""You've got bullishness from the OPEC cuts, but the bearishness of the inventory report,"" Hamza Khan, head of commodities strategy at ING, said. ""The question is, which of these is going to give first?""Brent and WTI have traded within a $5 per barrel price range this year, in what has become the longest and most range-bound period since a price slump began in mid-2014.In the United States, rising output has helped push up crude and fuel stocks to record highs.In Asia, oil flows into the region remain as high as they were before the production cuts, Thomson Reuters data shows, as exporters fight for market share.And there are also signs of faltering demand growth in core markets, China and India.In India, fuel demand growth fell in January, while in China sagging car sales and soaring gasoline and diesel exports also point to a slowdown in growth.That leaves Europe, where OPEC has significantly cut its sales. But Thomson Reuters data shows rising North Sea oil exports to Asia, indicating there is no real supply shortage in the region.Despite the supply glut, analysts expect oil markets to tighten in the longer term.""In the fourth quarter of 2018, global oil demand will most likely surpass 100 million barrels per day,"" AB Bernstein said on Friday in a note to clients.""If oil prices stay around $60 per barrel and GDP growth over 3 percent per annum, then oil demand growth will be stronger over the next 5 years, than the previous decade.

This situation was much better in January than in previous years,"" tourism ministry spokeswoman Omaima al-Husseini said.Visitors from China, Japan and Ukraine account for a large part of the growth.China´s top public travel agency, China International Travel Service, reported a 58 percent increase in tourists flying to Egypt compared with 2015.""There are more bookings between October 2016 and January 2017 than last year,"" said Egyptian Federation of Tourism chief Karim Mohsen.""There is an improvement, especially in cultural tourism in Cairo, Luxor and Aswan,"" key historical sites, he said.The uptick is a sign of hope for a country also reeling from the shock of an economic reform programme that has triggered massive inflation.Once a key foreign currency earner, the tourism sector crashed in 2011 after a popular uprising overthrew veteran strongman Hosni Mubarak, ushering in years of sporadic unrest.Recoveries in the sector since then have been set back by new crises.In June 2015, a massacre of tourists at a Luxor temple was narrowly averted when assailants armed with assault rifles and explosives bungled the attack and were intercepted by police.But in October that year, Islamic State group jihadists, who are waging an insurgency in the eastern Sinai Peninsula, struck again. They bombed a Russian airliner carrying holidaymakers home from the popular Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh.All 224 people on board were killed.Russia suspended flights to Egypt and Britain cut air links with Sharm el-Sheikh.Visitor numbers plunged from 9.3 million in 2015 to 5.3 million the following year, Husseini said.",2017-02-19,0.0,0.0,0.366967291967292,0.09848084014750681

He withdrew one Rs 2,000 note and that also turned out to be fake, the officer said, adding that the other notes in the bundle were genuine.The man left with the fake notes said that all the four notes he withdrew were fake. He noticed the deliberate mistakes on the notes like promise to pay the bearer two thousand coupons and Serial number 000000 and immediately brought it to polices notice after which a sub-inspector was sent to the ATM located at the T-Point of Tigri in Sangam Vihar.The policeman was unable to find any other customer with a similar complaint, so he withdrew a note from the ATM. The note that was dispensed confirmed  allegations.Police said they are yet to identify the people behind this but they registered a case of manufacturing documents resembling currency notes, using forged or counterfeit notes and of cheating under IPC sections 489-b, 489-e and 420.

""And today, all routes lead back to Gwadar.""Gwadar forms the southern Pakistan hub of a $57-billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) of infrastructure and energy projects Beijing announced in 2014.Since then, land prices have skyrocketed as property demand has spiked, and dozens of real estate firms want to cash in.""Gwadar is a 'Made in China' brand and everyone wants a piece,"" said realtor Afzal Adil, one of several who shifted operations from the eastern city of Lahore in 2015.Last year, Pakistan welcomed the first large shipment of Chinese goods at Gwadar, where the China Overseas Ports Holding Company Ltd took over operations in 2013. It plans to eventually handle 300 million to 400 million tons of cargo a year.It also aims to develop seafood processing plants in a nearby free trade zone sprawled over 923 hectares (2,281 acres).The route through Gwadar offers China its shortest path to the oil-rich Middle East, Africa, and most of the Western hemisphere, besides promising to open up remote, landlocked Xinjiang.Last year, the Applied Economics Research Centre estimated the corridor would create 700,000 jobs in Pakistan and a Chinese newspaper recently put the number at more than 2 million.Authorities have completed an expressway through Gwadar, which has a 350-km (218-mile) road network. A new international airport kicks off next year, to handle an influx of hundreds of Chinese traders and officials expected to live near the port.The volume of Gwadar property searches surged 14-fold on Pakistan's largest real estate database, Zameen.com, between 2014 and 2016, up from a prior rate of a few hundred a month.""It's like a gold rush,"" said Chief Executive Zeeshan Ali Khan. ""Anyone who is interested in real estate, be it an investor or a developer, is eyeing Gwadar.""Prices, which have risen two- to four-fold on average, are climbing ""on a weekly basis,"" said Saad Arshed, the Pakistan managing director of online real estate marketplace Lamudi.pk.Regional fishermen have held strikes during the last two years, to protest against being displaced by the port.To keep pace with the interest, urban officials are struggling to computerise land management and record-keeping. ""We are trying to upgrade as fast as we can,"" said Zakir Majeed, an official of the Gwadar Development Authority (GDA).But Gwadar lacks basic education and health facilities, in contrast to the gleaming towers and piped drinking water of the ""smart city"" envisioned by the GDA.""For commercial projects, things are moving fast,"" Lamudi's Arshed said. ""But people actually living there, that will take a long time.""Port officials expect the population to hit 2 million over the next two decades, from about 185,000 now.strong>RISK</strongThe government commissioned work on the Gwadar port in 2002, but development was held up by chronic instability in the surrounding resource-rich province of Baluchistan, where ethnic separatist rebels have chafed against a military crackdown.Since China announced the corridor plan in 2014, security has improved, with Pakistan setting up a new army division to ensure protection, while hundreds of rebels surrendered arms.Real estate firms dismiss fears the ""Gwadar bubble"" might still burst, pointing to China's enduring interest.""The risk is always there,"" Rafi said. ""But our confidence comes from knowing this is not a Pakistani initiative, but a Chinese city on the Arabian Sea coast. And the Chinese will see that it is built.""",2017-02-23,0.0,0.0,0.24858520267611178,0.07977567886658797

In September, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue granted sukuk similar tax treatment to conventional bonds.This has attracted a wide range of issuers: Byco Oil Pakistan Limited raised 3.12 billion rupees via sukuk using a credit gurantee and Ghani Gases raised 1.3 billion rupees via a privately-placed sukuk last month.In December, Fatima Fertilizer Company mandated banks to raise 10.5 billion rupees through a lease-based sukuk.Pakistan GasPort Consortium Limited plans to raise 8.6 billion rupees via seven-year sukuk to finance the construction of the country's second LNG import terminal.",2017-03-02,0.0,0.0,0.40118040873854816,0.06517416691835295

The Joint Ministerial Commission provides the best platform to take stock of bilateral cooperation in various economic sectors and setting new benchmarks to carry this cooperation forward.Referring to the level of bilateral trade between the two countries, the prime minister reiterated that this needed to be further enhanced to its fullest potential. Encouraging greater private sector interaction could enhance the existing level of trade as well as bridge the imbalance in existing trade patterns.Nawaz Sharif said over 114,000 Pakistanis live in Kuwait which was evidence of the strong ties existing between the two countries. It also confirmed the immense importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Kuwait.Nawaz Sharif also emphasized the importance of early resumption of GCC- Pakistan Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the support of Kuwait and most importantly spoke of the need for lifting of visa restrictions as it would remove a major hurdle in freedom of movement for the business community.He stressed that Pakistan was an investment friendly country and an attractive destination for foreign investors, due to its liberal investment policy and high rate of return.There are ample opportunities for investors, with one hundred percent equity or joint ventures in Pakistan. Over 1,000 leading multinational companies are currently successfully operating in various sectors of our economy.The Prime Minister said there were a number of energy and infrastructure development projects in Pakistan that could be considered by foreign investors. He said we would welcome further investments from Kuwait in mega infrastructure and energy projects being undertaken in Pakistan.Earlier, Nawaz Sharif was accorded a warm welcome upon arrival at the Bayan Palace with Guard of Honor.Meanwhile, talking to Speaker of Kuwaiti Parliament Marzouq Al-Ghanim in Kuwait City, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for greater parliamentary exchanges between Pakistan and Kuwait.He said these exchanges will enhance relations between the two countries.Speaker Marzouq briefed the Prime Minister about the proceeding of Kuwaiti Parliament.",2017-03-07,0.0,0.0,0.5690266299357208,0.2675321395775941

The B&amp;R initiative is a vital combination of geo-economics and geo-strategy.The Belt and Road (B&amp;R) is an innovative paradigm of global integration involving 65 countries, including one-third of the worlds GDP, impacting 65 percent of the worlds population and a quarter of all the goods and services, the website observed.Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in late 2013. It comprises the Belt, which is a network of roads across the world, and the Road which is actually a network of shipping lanes and ports.The project has a geo-strategic component focused on advancing Chinas economic goals and utilizing its industrial potential. It serves to remove Chinas dependence on the Malacca Strait for oil imports, improves trade connectivity, furthers Chinas foreign policy and minimizes conflicts as it reconnects the world.This project of the century has kept the world economy afloat since 2013 by withstanding the crash of the trans-Atlantic banking systems.As PricewaterhouseCoopers reports, the real value in Chinas economy and its investments in countries along its Belt and Road initiative is shifting to infrastructure projects and rising at a rapid pace.The B&amp;R is to be financed mainly by the Silk Road Fund and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. Additionally, the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership provides Beijing with the perfect opportunity to re-integrate Asian investment that used to find its way to American banks.Further prospects and direction of the B&amp;R initiative will be determined at the two sessions as the project is an integral part of Chinas new reforms and an intrinsic part of its foreign policy.China is going to hold the Belt and Road forum this May and it would be a masterstroke by China if more countries like U.S. and India announce their participation or signal their approval with their presence at this forum; the great game is never really over and there is much more scope in Chinese wisdom and peaceful globalization in the Eurasian Century.",2017-03-07,0.1,-0.1,0.36438653938653937,0.13246105746105746

Xinjiang was once a key transportation and trade hub on the ancient Silk Road.During this year's annual session of the National People's Congress, the Xinjiang delegation proposed the construction of high-speed railways linking the regional capital of Urumqi and southern Xinjiang's Kashgar, the starting point of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), as well as another one connecting Urumqi and northern Xinjiang's Horgos, a land port on the China-Kazakhstan border.The delegation also proposed starting construction on the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway, which has long been discussed and planned. The national lawmakers from Xinjiang believe it is urgent to start construction on the railway to enhance economic cooperation with the two Central Asian countries.A total of 223 westbound trains carrying construction materials, agricultural produce, garments and other merchandise traveled via nine cross-border routes linking Xinjiang to Central Asian countries in 2016, said Hu Kaijiang, director of the Xinjiang Economic and Information Commission.This year, Xinjiang plans to expand operations to run 400 westbound cross-border trains to facilitate exports of technology and equipment and seek new growth opportunities, Hu said.Geographic location, rich natural resources and preferential policies introduced to encourage opening-up have given Xinjiang advantages in becoming the core area on the economic belt, Shokrat said. Becoming a key player on the economic belt will also benefit the region's social development.Besides improving its transportation network, the region will focus on the development of key cities along the economic belt.

Arcelik could easily do another deal like last year's roughly $250 million purchase of Pakistan's Dawlance, but could also do something several times bigger, he said.""We're opportunistic. We're not restricted on size in any way.""Bulgurlu said international markets should account for 65 percent of Arcelik's sales this year, up from 60 percent in 2016, reaching 80 percent in a few years.Europe currently accounts for the large majority of international sales, though the company has a growing presence in Africa through its 2011 purchase of South Africa's Defy Appliances.GLOBAL UNCERTAINTYBulgurlu stood by Arcelik's forecast for revenue to grow 20 percent this year from 16.10 billion Turkish lira ($4.43 billion) in 2016, even though its overall home market could grow faster than the 3 percent it had previously forecast.The stronger market in Turkey is due to a recent government move to reduce a tax on white goods in order to spur demand. Still, the weak lira has made raw materials such as oil, steel and plastic more expensive, impacting profitability.""There's a lot of uncertainty in the world,"" Bulgurlu said, also citing the weak pound that has caused inflationary pressure in Britain, which accounts for 10 percent of sales.The company had to raise prices on some UK products and expects that to temper demand, especially after there was a surge due to expectations of future price rises.""I think demand will taper off a little,"" Bulgurlu said, noting however that Arcelik still aimed to double its business in Britain in the next five years, even as the country's exit from the European Union raises questions about the economy and the future of foreign workers.""It will continue to be our most important market outside Turkey,"" he said.Arcelik opened a research and development center in Cambridge, eastern England, last year, in an effort to take advantage of a British tradition for scientific innovation.""We want to tap into that and take that pure research and make it applicable to appliances,"" Bulgurlu said, citing potential for smart appliances such as refrigerators that know when food is going bad and ovens that can keep food cool until its time to cook.",2017-03-21,1.0,0.0,0.37393273393273396,0.032871295371295364
4327,Saudis to tighten curbs on foreign workers in local jobs pu,"strong>RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia plans to tighten restrictions on foreign workers to pressure companies into hiring more Saudi citizens and reduce unemployment among Saudis, government sources said on Monday.</strongThe new policy could help the kingdom achieve one goal of economic reforms launched last year to ease joblessness among Saudis from the current 12.1 percent to 9 percent by 2020.But by making it harder for firms to employ low-paid foreign workers, thereby raising costs, the policy may complicate other aspects of the reform drive such as developing private sector businesses and diversifying the economy beyond oil.The new rules could potentially affect large numbers of people since about 12 million foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, doing many of the strenuous, dangerous and lower-paid jobs shunned by 20 million Saudi citizens. About two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the public sector.Under a program launched in 2011 and known as Nitaqat, the Labor Ministry grades firms according to the ratios of Saudis in their workforces. Companies with higher ratios get preferential treatment when obtaining visas for foreign workers or licenses; those in lower categories face penalties.Under the new policy, construction firms with between 500 and 2,999 workers would have to employ 100 percent Saudis to be in the top ""platinum"" category; if they employ 10 percent, they are rated ""lower green"". This compares to current levels of 16 percent for platinum and 6 percent for lower green.In the retail sector, a large company's current percentages are 35 percent for platinum and 24 percent for lower green. This would rise to 100 percent for platinum and 35 percent for lower green, according to an official document seen by Reuters.Policy will also tightened in many other sectors, according to the document, which lists more than 60 industries in which restrictions will be applied.Some change is already occurring in Saudi employment practice, with many citizens now working as cashiers and sales people in retail shops - the sort of jobs previously seen as undesirable. But there is still a scarcity of Saudis willing and qualified to work in the construction sector.The tighter policy has been approved by Labor Minister Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis, the sources said.

The multilevel coaches will meet ""Buy America"" requirements, with 60 percent or more of the parts, labor and fabrication done in the US.CRRC MA came in with a low bid of $137.5 million, easily besting competitors Bombardier, which bid $171.5 million and the $187.8 million bid by Hyundai Rotem.CRRC MA's deal includes an option for 10 more cars, which, if exercised, would result in the contract's value rising to $161 million, still below the base bids by Bombardier and Hyundai Rotem.The first of the coaches are expected to be delivered in late 2019. They will be paired with SEPTA's new electric locomotives, which are being built by Siemens of Germany.<br/>The multilevel coaches will be produced primarily at CRRC MA's main US manufacturing facility in Springfield, Massachusetts.It is the latest win for CRRC.

Dubai International Airport expects 89 million passengers this year.The United States announced a ban on all electronics larger than a standard smartphone on board direct flights out of eight countries across the middle East. US officials would not specify how long the ban will last, but Dubai-based Emirates told AFP that it had been instructed to enforce it until at least October 14.Travellers using 10 airports across the Middle East and North Africa are subject to the ban.The ban also covers all electronics sold at Dubai Duty Free, Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths told local radio earlier this week.Government-owned Emirates operates 18 flights daily to the United States out of Dubai. In an attempt to appease its customers, the airline announced it would be offering complimentary packing and shipping services at gates to enable passengers to use their electronic devices after check-in and until boarding.Adding to the complication on Saturday, a number of flights out of Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports were delayed due to thunderstorms, including an Emirates flight to Houston.The US ban affects nine airlines from eight countries: Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Britain has also announced a parallel ban, effective Saturday, targeting all flights out of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Lebanon.Abu Dhabi, home to UAE national carrier Etihad Airways, is one of the few international airports with a US Customs and Border Protection Facility, which processes immigration and customs inspections before departure.""All Etihad Airways guests travelling to the United States clear US Immigration and Customs at the US Preclearance facility in Terminal 3, the only one of its kind in the Middle East,"" read a statement emailed to AFP.""When guests land in the US, they arrive as domestic passengers with no requirement to queue for immigration checks again.""The bans have come under criticism for targeting majority-Muslim countries.

In September, Pakistan's Federal Board of Revenue granted sukuk similar tax treatment to conventional bonds.This has attracted a wide range of issuers: Byco Oil Pakistan Limited raised 3.12 billion rupees via sukuk using a credit gurantee and Ghani Gases raised 1.3 billion rupees via a privately-placed sukuk last month.In December, Fatima Fertilizer Company mandated banks to raise 10.5 billion rupees through a lease-based sukuk.Pakistan GasPort Consortium Limited plans to raise 8.6 billion rupees via seven-year sukuk to finance the construction of the country's second LNG import terminal.",2017-03-02,0.0,0.0,0.40118040873854816,0.06517416691835295

The Joint Ministerial Commission provides the best platform to take stock of bilateral cooperation in various economic sectors and setting new benchmarks to carry this cooperation forward.Referring to the level of bilateral trade between the two countries, the prime minister reiterated that this needed to be further enhanced to its fullest potential. Encouraging greater private sector interaction could enhance the existing level of trade as well as bridge the imbalance in existing trade patterns.Nawaz Sharif said over 114,000 Pakistanis live in Kuwait which was evidence of the strong ties existing between the two countries. It also confirmed the immense importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Kuwait.Nawaz Sharif also emphasized the importance of early resumption of GCC- Pakistan Free Trade Agreement negotiations with the support of Kuwait and most importantly spoke of the need for lifting of visa restrictions as it would remove a major hurdle in freedom of movement for the business community.He stressed that Pakistan was an investment friendly country and an attractive destination for foreign investors, due to its liberal investment policy and high rate of return.There are ample opportunities for investors, with one hundred percent equity or joint ventures in Pakistan. Over 1,000 leading multinational companies are currently successfully operating in various sectors of our economy.The Prime Minister said there were a number of energy and infrastructure development projects in Pakistan that could be considered by foreign investors. He said we would welcome further investments from Kuwait in mega infrastructure and energy projects being undertaken in Pakistan.Earlier, Nawaz Sharif was accorded a warm welcome upon arrival at the Bayan Palace with Guard of Honor.Meanwhile, talking to Speaker of Kuwaiti Parliament Marzouq Al-Ghanim in Kuwait City, the Prime Minister emphasized the need for greater parliamentary exchanges between Pakistan and Kuwait.He said these exchanges will enhance relations between the two countries.Speaker Marzouq briefed the Prime Minister about the proceeding of Kuwaiti Parliament.",2017-03-07,0.0,0.0,0.5690266299357208,0.2675321395775941

The B&amp;R initiative is a vital combination of geo-economics and geo-strategy.The Belt and Road (B&amp;R) is an innovative paradigm of global integration involving 65 countries, including one-third of the worlds GDP, impacting 65 percent of the worlds population and a quarter of all the goods and services, the website observed.Chinese President Xi Jinping announced the Belt and Road Initiative in late 2013. It comprises the Belt, which is a network of roads across the world, and the Road which is actually a network of shipping lanes and ports.The project has a geo-strategic component focused on advancing Chinas economic goals and utilizing its industrial potential. It serves to remove Chinas dependence on the Malacca Strait for oil imports, improves trade connectivity, furthers Chinas foreign policy and minimizes conflicts as it reconnects the world.This project of the century has kept the world economy afloat since 2013 by withstanding the crash of the trans-Atlantic banking systems.As PricewaterhouseCoopers reports, the real value in Chinas economy and its investments in countries along its Belt and Road initiative is shifting to infrastructure projects and rising at a rapid pace.The B&amp;R is to be financed mainly by the Silk Road Fund and the Asia Infrastructure Investment Bank. Additionally, the collapse of the Trans-Pacific Partnership provides Beijing with the perfect opportunity to re-integrate Asian investment that used to find its way to American banks.Further prospects and direction of the B&amp;R initiative will be determined at the two sessions as the project is an integral part of Chinas new reforms and an intrinsic part of its foreign policy.China is going to hold the Belt and Road forum this May and it would be a masterstroke by China if more countries like U.S. and India announce their participation or signal their approval with their presence at this forum; the great game is never really over and there is much more scope in Chinese wisdom and peaceful globalization in the Eurasian Century.",2017-03-07,0.1,-0.1,0.36438653938653937,0.13246105746105746

We're not restricted on size in any way.""Bulgurlu said international markets should account for 65 percent of Arcelik's sales this year, up from 60 percent in 2016, reaching 80 percent in a few years.Europe currently accounts for the large majority of international sales, though the company has a growing presence in Africa through its 2011 purchase of South Africa's Defy Appliances.GLOBAL UNCERTAINTYBulgurlu stood by Arcelik's forecast for revenue to grow 20 percent this year from 16.10 billion Turkish lira ($4.43 billion) in 2016, even though its overall home market could grow faster than the 3 percent it had previously forecast.The stronger market in Turkey is due to a recent government move to reduce a tax on white goods in order to spur demand. Still, the weak lira has made raw materials such as oil, steel and plastic more expensive, impacting profitability.""There's a lot of uncertainty in the world,"" Bulgurlu said, also citing the weak pound that has caused inflationary pressure in Britain, which accounts for 10 percent of sales.The company had to raise prices on some UK products and expects that to temper demand, especially after there was a surge due to expectations of future price rises.""I think demand will taper off a little,"" Bulgurlu said, noting however that Arcelik still aimed to double its business in Britain in the next five years, even as the country's exit from the European Union raises questions about the economy and the future of foreign workers.""It will continue to be our most important market outside Turkey,"" he said.Arcelik opened a research and development center in Cambridge, eastern England, last year, in an effort to take advantage of a British tradition for scientific innovation.""We want to tap into that and take that pure research and make it applicable to appliances,"" Bulgurlu said, citing potential for smart appliances such as refrigerators that know when food is going bad and ovens that can keep food cool until its time to cook.",2017-03-21,1.0,0.0,0.37393273393273396,0.032871295371295364
4342,Saudis to tighten curbs on foreign workers in local jobs pu,"strong>RIYADH/DUBAI: Saudi Arabia plans to tighten restrictions on foreign workers to pressure companies into hiring more Saudi citizens and reduce unemployment among Saudis, government sources said on Monday.</strongThe new policy could help the kingdom achieve one goal of economic reforms launched last year to ease joblessness among Saudis from the current 12.1 percent to 9 percent by 2020.But by making it harder for firms to employ low-paid foreign workers, thereby raising costs, the policy may complicate other aspects of the reform drive such as developing private sector businesses and diversifying the economy beyond oil.The new rules could potentially affect large numbers of people since about 12 million foreigners work in Saudi Arabia, doing many of the strenuous, dangerous and lower-paid jobs shunned by 20 million Saudi citizens. About two-thirds of Saudi workers are employed by the public sector.Under a program launched in 2011 and known as Nitaqat, the Labor Ministry grades firms according to the ratios of Saudis in their workforces. Companies with higher ratios get preferential treatment when obtaining visas for foreign workers or licenses; those in lower categories face penalties.Under the new policy, construction firms with between 500 and 2,999 workers would have to employ 100 percent Saudis to be in the top ""platinum"" category; if they employ 10 percent, they are rated ""lower green"". This compares to current levels of 16 percent for platinum and 6 percent for lower green.In the retail sector, a large company's current percentages are 35 percent for platinum and 24 percent for lower green. This would rise to 100 percent for platinum and 35 percent for lower green, according to an official document seen by Reuters.Policy will also tightened in many other sectors, according to the document, which lists more than 60 industries in which restrictions will be applied.Some change is already occurring in Saudi employment practice, with many citizens now working as cashiers and sales people in retail shops - the sort of jobs previously seen as undesirable. But there is still a scarcity of Saudis willing and qualified to work in the construction sector.The tighter policy has been approved by Labor Minister Ali bin Nasser al-Ghafis, the sources said. It is scheduled to take effect on Sept. 3, one source said, declining to be named because an official announcement has not yet been made.",2017-03-21,0.0625,-0.0625,0.39305391578118865,0.07412108093926276
4343,Chinese train manufacturer wins railcar bid in US,"strong>BEIJING: A Chinese rail company has won a contract in the United States recently despite President Donald Trumps America First campaign and promise to support local industry.</strongTrain and rail equipment manufacturer, China Railway Rolling Stock Corp won the contract beating Canadas Bombardier Inc and South Koreas Hyundai Rotem.Philadelphia city government on Thursday approved the purchase of 45 multilevel coaches from the Chinese train giant's subsidiary, CRRC MA, for its regional rail network, Peoples Daily reported Saturday.The contract award was based on technical ratings and pricing, said the authority, with CRRC's proposal offering the best value. The multilevel coaches will meet ""Buy America"" requirements, with 60 percent or more of the parts, labor and fabrication done in the US.CRRC MA came in with a low bid of $137.5 million, easily besting competitors Bombardier, which bid $171.5 million and the $187.8 million bid by Hyundai Rotem.CRRC MA's deal includes an option for 10 more cars, which, if exercised, would result in the contract's value rising to $161 million, still below the base bids by Bombardier and Hyundai Rotem.The first of the coaches are expected to be delivered in late 2019. They will be paired with SEPTA's new electric locomotives, which are being built by Siemens of Germany.<br/>The multilevel coaches will be produced primarily at CRRC MA's main US manufacturing facility in Springfield, Massachusetts.It is the latest win for CRRC. Last week, CRRC Sifang America broke ground in Chicago for a $100 million plant that will build railcars for the city's transit authority.",2017-03-25,0.1,0.15,0.39869146005509637,0.15847107438016528
4344,Laptop ban hits Dubai for 11m weekend traveller,"strong>DUBAI: Dubai International Airport and its flag carrier Emirates began implementing a ban on laptops and tablets on direct flights to the US Saturday, on one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.</strong1.1 million people are expected to pass through the busiest international airport as the city marks UAE spring break, Dubai Airports´ senior vice president for communications Anita Mehra said.An estimated 260,000 travellers were expected to pass through each day from Friday through Monday. Dubai International Airport expects 89 million passengers this year.The United States announced a ban on all electronics larger than a standard smartphone on board direct flights out of eight countries across the middle East. US officials would not specify how long the ban will last, but Dubai-based Emirates told AFP that it had been instructed to enforce it until at least October 14.Travellers using 10 airports across the Middle East and North Africa are subject to the ban.The ban also covers all electronics sold at Dubai Duty Free, Dubai Airports CEO Paul Griffiths told local radio earlier this week.Government-owned Emirates operates 18 flights daily to the United States out of Dubai. In an attempt to appease its customers, the airline announced it would be offering complimentary packing and shipping services at gates to enable passengers to use their electronic devices after check-in and until boarding.Adding to the complication on Saturday, a number of flights out of Dubai and Abu Dhabi airports were delayed due to thunderstorms, including an Emirates flight to Houston.The US ban affects nine airlines from eight countries: Turkey, Morocco, Jordan, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.Britain has also announced a parallel ban, effective Saturday, targeting all flights out of Egypt, Turkey, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia and Lebanon.Abu Dhabi, home to UAE national carrier Etihad Airways, is one of the few international airports with a US Customs and Border Protection Facility, which processes immigration and customs inspections before departure.""All Etihad Airways guests travelling to the United States clear US Immigration and Customs at the US Preclearance facility in Terminal 3, the only one of its kind in the Middle East,"" read a statement emailed to AFP.""When guests land in the US, they arrive as domestic passengers with no requirement to queue for immigration checks again.""The bans have come under criticism for targeting majority-Muslim countries. The US ban in particular has raised eyebrows for covering airports from which US airlines do not operate direct flights.The United States and Britain have cited intelligence indicating passenger jets could be targeted with explosives planted in such devices.",2017-03-25,0.0,0.0,0.3027777777777778,0.04318181818181819
